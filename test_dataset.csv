 a better investment than the stock market   all our mailings are sent complying to the proposed h  r  3113 unsolicited  commercial electronic mail act of 2000  please see the bottom of this  message for further information and removal instructions   parents of 15  year old  find  71  000 cash hidden in  his closet   does this headline look familiar  of course it does  you most likely have  just seen this story recently featured on a major nightly news program  usa    and reported elsewhere in the world  including my neck of the woods   new zealand   his mother was cleaning and putting laundry away when  she came across a large brown paper bag that was suspiciously buried  beneath some clothes and a skateboard in the back of her 15  year  old  sons closet  nothing could have prepared her for the shock she got when  she opened the bag and found it was full of cash  five  dollar bills  twenties   fifties and hundreds  all neatly rubber  banded in labelled piles    my first thought was that he had robbed a bank   says the 41  year  old  woman   there was over  71  000 dollars in that bag   that  s more than my  husband earns in a year    the woman immediately called her husband at the car  dealership where  he worked to tell him what she had discovered  he came home right away  and they drove together to the boys school and picked him up  little did  they suspect that where the money came from was more shocking than  actually finding it in the closet   as it turns out  the boy had been sending out  via e  mail  a type of   report  to e  mail addresses that he obtained off the internet  everyday  after school for the past 2 months  he had been doing this right on his  computer in his bedroom    i just got the e  mail one day and i figured what the heck  i put my name  on it like the instructions said and i started sending it out   says the clever  15  year  old   the e  mail letter listed 5 addresses and contained instructions to send one   5 dollar bill to each person on the list  then delete the address at the top  and move the others addresses down  and finally to add your name to  the top of the list   the letter goes on to state that you would receive several thousand  dollars in five  dollar bills within 2 weeks if you sent out the letter with your  name at the top of the 5  address list   i get junk e  mail all the time  and  really did not think it was going to work   the boy continues   within the first few days of sending out the e  mail  the post office box  that his parents had gotten him for his video  game magazine subscriptions  began to fill up with not magazines  but envelopes containing  5 bills    about a week later i rode  my bike  down to the post office and my box  had 1 magazine and about 300 envelops stuffed in it  there was also a  yellow slip that said i had to go up to the  post office  counter  i thought i  was in trouble or something  laughs    he goes on   i went up to the  counter and they had a whole box of more mail for me  i had to ride back  home and empty out my backpack because i could not carry it all   over  the next few weeks  the boy continued sending out the e  mail   the  money just kept coming in and i just kept sorting it and stashing it in the  closet  barely had time for my homework   he had also been riding his bike  to several of the banks in his area and exchanging the  5 bills for twenties   fifties and hundreds    i didn  t want the banks to get suspicious so i kept riding to different banks  with like five thousand at a time in my backpack  i would usually tell the  lady at the bank counter that my dad had sent me in to exchange the  money  and he was outside waiting for me  one time the lady gave me a  really strange look and told me that she would not be able to do it for me  and my dad would have to come in and do it  but i just rode to the next  bank down the street  laughs    surprisingly  the boy did not have any  reason to be afraid  the reporting news  team examined and investigated the so  called  chain  letter  the boy was  sending out and found that it was not a chain  letter at all  in fact  it was  completely legal according to us postal and lottery laws  title 18   section 1302 and 1341  or title 18  section 3005 in the us code  also in  the code of federal regulations  volume 16  sections 255 and 436  which  state a product or service must be exchanged for money received   every five  dollar bill that he received contained a little note that read    please send me report number xyx   this simple note made the letter  legal because he was exchanging a service  a report on how  to  for a  five  dollar fee    this is the end of the media release  if you would like to understand how  the system works and get your  71  000  please continue reading  what  appears below is what the 15 year old was sending out on the net   you can use it too  just follow the simple instructions    be financially free like others within a year    before you  say  bull   please read the following  this is the letter you have been  hearing about on the news lately  due to the popularity of this letter on the  internet  a national weekly news program recently devoted an entire  show to the investigation of this program described below  to see if it really  can make people money  the show also investigated whether or not the  program was legal  their findings proved once and for all that there are   absolutely no laws prohibiting the participation in the program and if  people can follow the simple instructions  they are bound to make some  megabucks with only  25 out of pocket cost    due to the recent increase of popularity  respect this  program has attained  it is currently working better  than ever   note  follow the directons below  i had best results the second time when  i hired a bulk email service in addition to following the reports instructions   in order for all of us to be successful  many  many emails must be sent so  that the returns are many  i have been extremely successful using the  following company  they send out the offers  and all i do is accept money  for reports  then i send back to the people as soon as possible   this is what one had to say   thanks to this profitable opportunity  i was  approached many times before but each time i passed on it  i am so glad i  finally joined just to see what one could expect in return for the minimal  effort and money required  to my astonishment  i received total   610  470  00 in 21 weeks  with money still coming in    pam hedland  fort lee  new jersey   here is another testimonial   this program has been around for a long time  but i never believed in it  but one day when i received this again in the  mail i decided to gamble my  25 on it  i followed the simple instructions  and walaa      3 weeks later the money started to come in  first month i  only made  240  00 but the next 2 months after that i made a total of   290  000  00  so far  in the past 8 months by re  entering the program  i  have made over  710  000  00 and i am playing it again  the key to  success in this program is to follow the simple steps and not change  anything   more testimonials later but first   print this now for your future reference      order all 5 reports shown on the list below     for each report  send  5 cash  the name  number of the  report you are ordering and your e  mail address to the  person whose name appears on that list next to the report  make  sure your return address is on your envelope top left  corner in case of any mail problems   when you place your order  make sure you order each of the 5 reports   you will need all 5 reports so that you can save them on your computer   within a few days you will receive  vie e  mail  each of the 5 reports from  these 5 different individuals  save them on your computer so they will be  accessible for you to send to the 1  000  s of people who will order them from  you  also make a floppy of these reports and keep it on your desk in case  something happens to your computer   important  do not alter the names of the people who are listed next  to each report  or their sequence on the list  in any way other than what is  instructed below in step  1 through 6  or you will loose out on majority of  your profits  once you understand the way this works  you will also see  how it does not work if you change it  remember  this method has been  tested  and if you alter  it will not work    people have tried to put their  friends  relatives names on all five thinking they could get all the money   but it does not work this way  believe us  we all have tried to be greedy  and then nothing happened  so do not try to change anything other than  what is instructed  because if you do  it will not work for you  remember   honesty reaps the reward     1     after you have ordered all 5 reports  take this advertisement and  remove the name  address of the person in report  5  this person  has made it through the cycle and is no doubt counting their fortune   2     move the name  address in report  4 down to report  5   3     move the name  address in report  3 down to report  4   4     move the name  address in report  2 down to report  3   5     move the name  address in report  1 down to report  2  6     insert your name  address in the report  1 position   please make sure you copy every name  address accurately       take this entire letter  with the modified list of names  and save it on  your computer  do not make any other changes  save this on a  disk as well just in case if you loose any data  to assist you with marketing  your business on the internet  the 5 reports you purchase will provide you  with invaluable marketing information which includes how to send bulk  e  mails legally  where to find thousands of free classified ads and much  more  there are 2 primary methods to get this venture going   method  1  by sending bulk e  mail legally  let  s say that you decide to start small  just to see how it goes  and we will  assume you and those involved send out only 5  000 e  mails each  let  s  also assume that the mailing receive only a 0  2  response  the response  could be much better but lets just say it is only 0  2   also many people  will send out hundreds of thousands e  mails instead of only 5  000 each    continuing with this example  you send out only 5  000 e  mails   with a 0  2  response  that is only 10 orders for report  1  those 10  people responded by sending out 5  000 e  mail each for a total of 50  000   out of those 50  000 e  mails only 0  2  responded with orders  that equals  100 people responded and ordered report  2   those 100 people mail out 5  000 e  mails each for a total of 500  000 e  mails   the 0  2  response to that is 1000 orders for report  3   those 1000 people send out 5  000 e  mails each for a total of 5 million  e  mails sent out  the 0  2  response to that is 10  000 orders for report  4   those 10  000 people send out 5  000 e  mails each for a total of  50  000  000  50 million  e  mails  the 0  2  response to that is 100  000  orders for report  5  that  s 100  000 orders times   5 each   500  000  00  half million   your total income in this example is   1       50  2       500  3       5  000  4       50  000  5       500  000         grand total   555  550  00  numbers do not lie  get a pencil  paper and figure out  the worst possible responses and no matter how you  calculate it  you will still make a lot of money   remember friend  this is assuming only 10 people  ordering out of 5  000 you mailed to  dare to think for a moment  what would happen if everyone or half or even one 4 th of those people  mailed 100  000 e  mails each or more  there are over 150 million people on  the internet worldwide and counting  believe me  many people will do just  that  and more   method  2  by placing free ads on the internet  advertising on the net is very very inexpensive and there are hundreds of  free places to advertise  placing a lot of free ads on the internet will  easily get a larger response   we strongly suggest you start with method  1 and add method  2 as  you go along  for every  5 you receive  all you must do is e  mail them the  report they ordered  that  s it  always provide same day service on all  orders  this will guarantee that the e  mail they send out with your name  and address on it  will be prompt because they can not advertise until they  receive the report    order each report by its number  name only  notes  always  send  5 cash  u  s  currency  for each report  checks not  accepted  make sure the cash is concealed by wrapping it in at least 2  sheets of paper or aluminum foil  on one of those sheets of paper  write  the number  the name of the report you are ordering  your e  mail  address and your name and postal address   place your order for these reports

for you  and the cash will  continue to roll in  this is important to remember  every time  your name is moved down on the list  you are placed in front of a different  report  you can keep track of your progress by watching which  report people are ordering from you  if you want to generate  more income send another batch of e  mails and start  the whole process again  there is no limit to the

instructed above  one of the people you send this to may send out  100  000 or more e  mails and your name will be on every one of them   remember though  the more you send out the more potential customers  you will reach  so my friend  i have given you the ideas  information   materials and opportunity to become financially independent   it is up to you now                   more testimonials                   my name is mitchell  my wife  jody and i live in chicago  i am an  accountant with a major u  s  corporation and i make pretty good money   when i received this program i grumbled to jody about receiving   junk mail   i made fun of the whole thing  spouting my knowledge of the  population and percentages involved  i  knew  it wouldn  t work  jody  totally ignored my supposed intelligence and few days later she jumped in  with both feet  i made merciless fun of her  and was ready to lay the old   i told you so  on her when the thing didn  t work  well  the laugh was on  me  within 3 weeks she had received 50 responses  within the next 45  days she had received total  147  200  00     all cash  i was shocked   i have joined jody in her  hobby    mitchell wolf  chicago  illinois   not being the gambling type  it took me several weeks to make up my  mind to participate in this plan  but conservative that i am  i decided that  the initial investment was so little that there was just no way that i  wouldn  t get enough orders to at least get my money back    i was  surprised when i found my medium size post office box crammed with  orders  i made  319  210  00 in the first 12 weeks  the nice thing about  this deal is that it does not matter where people live  there simply isn  t a  better investment with a faster return and so big    dan sondstrom  alberta

was e  mailed again by someone  else       11 months passed then it luckily came again       i did not delete  this one  i made more than  490  000 on my first try and all the money  came within 22

 california 1  17  01 pt  ii  one of the issues we have been following with respect to the california power  crisis concerns the role of prospective broader federal involvement in the  issue post  inauguration  in the last two days  we have seen two signals  suggesting that the bush administration will not significantly deviate from  the  broker  role played by the clinton white house   1  in his confirmation hearing this morning  treasury secretary  designate  o  neill cautioned that  it is not clear that us intervention is needed in  california  and that the  governor must be the first line of defense    2  a source close to bush economic advisor larry lindsey reported to us  yesterday that  there was little that the federal government could do  specifically to help  beyond focusing on national issues  increased  production  transmission capacity etc      of course  the bush treasury officials are likely to be more cautious with  respect to intervention than the energy team  as was true with the clinton  administration  yet lindsey in particular is unlikely to deviate far from  the official bush view at this stage  further guidance should be forthcoming  with respect to this issue from energy secretary  designate spence abraham  s  testimony tomorrow ,0

 dispatch within maharashtra  jim   please find attached some slides that show the results of the henwood run  giving dispatch for the dabhol plant within maharashtra  i have also sent  the presentation we made to you to wade  he is to get back on when would be  an appropriate time for him to go over the presentation with me   vince  stinson and i have placed ourselves on rebecca  s calender for friday   and we will make the complete pitch to her  it would be great if you too  could be present at the meeting  if it is possible  please do let me know   on the attached slides  please note that   the slides all assume that there is a 1 part power tariff  mseb liability for  the entire capacity payment is not considered   the henwood model was with no power flowing out of maharashtra  when variable o  m costs  fixed o though in  some months  jan  it goes as high as  69 mm  hence  overall  mseb can pay  for the dispatches as shown in the henwood run provided  they are not paying  for the capacity payment for the whole 2184 mw plant   in conclusion  therefore  mseb has the need for between 1200 to 410 mw on a  seasonal basis  this means that the power remaining to be sold to other  states is the difference between that and 2184 mw   however  since the demand within maharashtra varies seasonally  it may mean  that we need to market seasonal products to other states  not long term  blocks   these are our conclusions  we may continue to work some more on the fuel and  hedging side  if you have any more questions for me  please let me know   else for now there will not be any new henwood runs   regards   sandeep ,0

 sr  director position  vince  as you requested  i have obtained some information from norma  relating to the salary parameters of the sr  director position  the minimum  salary is  83  800  and the maximum is  168  000  huge range  isn  t it     however  norma did ask me to bring a couple of things to your attention  the  lowest salary of a vp in your group is currently  140  000  and the average  director  s salary in your group is  120  000  those numbers narrow the  range considerably  of course  there is no equity issue since there is no  other senior director in your group   hope this information helps   molly,0

 full circle  asps the new big blue   network world fusion focus  mike jude and nancy meachim  on application service providers  today  s focus  full circle  asps the new big blue   03  15  00  dear wincenty kaminski   today  s focus  full circle  asps the new  big blue   by mike jude and nancy meachim  the terms   asp  8 and   ibm  8 may have more in common than being three   letter acronyms   remember big blue of the early   60 s  the vision  then  was centralized  computing  mainframe computers hosted complex  expensive applications  that end users accessed via dumb terminals  it infrastructure   especially memory  was expensive and needed to be controlled  with  computing resources centralized  ibm reasoned  they were easier to  maintain   of course  ibm got it wrong  in that computers became a cheap commodity   and users weren   t happy simply using dumb terminals  they wanted a  bigger share in all that technology offered  so  as memory prices fell   so did the idea of central control  dumb terminals were transformed into  intelligent desktop machines that could store applications and data  the  glass house populated by white  smocked technicians went out of fashion   looking back on those times  many of us would shake our heads and wonder  how ibm could have been so wrong  but maybe big blue wasn   t so far off   thanks to the advent of application service providers  centralized  computing is making a comeback  asps offer centralized application  management   the market started as a way to offer the benefits of server  advertisement protocol and other complex enterprise resource planning  software to small companies or companies with less technical savvy  but  asps now host all kinds of applications  including small  multilicensed  programs whose images are downloaded to end users on demand  but  the  principle remains the same  central control makes support much more  efficient and usually cheaper  how about that  ibm   to be fair  the dynamics of an asp are very different from old  centralized mainframe operations  an asp doesn   t just host and support  an application for general distribution over an in  house proprietary  network  unlike the ibm vision  an asp is very dependent on network  service  it is also very sensitive to service levels  in the   60 s  if  the mainframe let you down  you ended up twiddling your thumbs for an  hour or so  and your only recourse was that white  smocked fellow   nowadays  users start to scream if service is interrupted for even a  minute  and woe to the asp who brings down a customer operation  the  world of the asp is much more complex than that of the old   60 s shop   however  if one could magically transport a computer user from the   60 s  to the wonderful new 2000 s  would it seem all that different to him  in  an ideal asp world  a la scott mcnealy   s vision  users would sit down  at a semidumb terminal  download the application du jour  and start  working  what did the   60 s user do  kind of the same thing   so you are probably wondering  what is the point  just this  ibm   s  problem was leaving the customer out of the equation  and look what  happened  customers rebelled  they didn   t buy ibm   s spiel  it became  the   in  8 thing to hate ibm  why  because the guys in white smocks  couldn   t spell service and didn   t care about customers   to be successful  asps need to learn from the past  they need to tattoo  service on the forehead of each of their employees  there are too many  choices  today  for customers to put up with inferior service  that   s  one big difference from the   60 s  customers now can literally choose  any service provider in the world  just being big doesn   t cut it these  days   to contact mike jude and nancy

 ppi index short  term models  hi martina i believe that the  forecasts are accurately reflecting this  please see graphs below   both models really need our rpi curve to be linked  at the moment i have just  copied the 2  3  number forward   because the auto  regressive error term is  not very important  we can run the models forward with reasonable  confidence  as i mentioned  i don  t think we can really run this model more  than 12 months  in fact  i think we should run for 9  12 months and blend the  next 3  4 months out with the long  term model   hope i can fix the long  term ones now with some new insight   regards   anjam  x 35383  pllu  dzcv ,0

 a basic idea of price  offer matching clauses  vince   here is the basic idea i was alluding to   suppose a car dealer promised to  match any advertised price   then his  competitor would feel the need to respond in kind  and so on  until all  dealers advertised they would  match any advertised price   now  consider one  of these dealer  s decision to perhaps lower his prices  if he does so   everyone will immediately match his price  so his market share will remain  unchanged  at whatever it was before  but his revenues  and all other dealers  as well  would be lowered by the amount of his price reduction  so  the  dealer rationally decides not to lower his prices to try to sell more cars   now  suppose a limited partnership  where the partners contract to  control   who they are in business with  by putting a  right of first refusal  clause  into the partnership  s papers  whereby any partner wishing to sell his  interests must offer the remaining partners the right to match any offer the  partner received from outside for his shares  now  suppose you are an  outsider  considering doing your due diligence in the thought you might want  to buy into the partnership  you know if your offer is a  good  one from your  perspective  offering you the prospects of a fair rate of return  the  existing partners will match it  and you will get nothing in the deal but you  will have paid  from your own pocket  for your due diligence  conversely  if  you offer too much for the shares  then the other partners will not match  your offer and you will then realize you overpaid  in neither case can you  credibly assume you know more about the business than do the current  partners  so  you  basically  don  t make an offer  so  a partner  s shares  are seriously devalued by his partners having the right to match any offers  he receives for them  the  right of first refusal  clause precludes  economically efficient rebalancing of portfolios by rendering the shares   essentially  illiquid   clayton,0

 re  real options presentation  thanks for the comments grant  the presentation is for a couple of external  conferences that vince volunteered me for  vince has ok  d the content  and  stinson raised exactly the same issues as you  unfortunately i just don  t  seem to be getting any response from risk whatsoever on the publication of my  article  so these conferences will be the public debut for my real options  notation   of course the discounting  risk neutrality thing is where the real judgement  sits  when questions arise i  ll take the line that while research formulates  the models using appropriate derivatives  market based valuation methods  we  work with our rac group which considers the discounting to be associated with  various risks  and chooses these rates appropriately  the notation makes  clear which uncertainties we are exposed to at different stages of the deals   which assists in choosing the rates   in practice i  m not yet at the stage where originators are using my notation  yet  another reason i can  t say too much about its actual use at the  conference  i  m producing various tools for deterministic hydro  optimization  gbm swing option valuation  and deterministic dp optimization  for genset dispatch which people want right now  i  m working in the  background on the kind of modelling my notation demands  people are getting  to know me as a guy who can solve their immediate problems  and they  ll be  more likely to listen when i start rolling out the  proper  options  based  models  my notation is currently used only in the specs i  m writing for the  tools i  m producing   i  ll be turning dale  s spreadsheet  based power plant spread model into an  american monte carlo tool  which will then be available for inclusion in  other models  i think by the end of the summer the real options theoretical  work will start to bear fruit  one year after i initially proposed the  notation  with the quant it group i  m co  creating in place  i may yet see  the automated diagramming  pricing tool made real   thanks also for the pointer to tom halliburton  the use of the lingo  lp  integer package is something i  ve been presented with for the teesside  plant operation optimizer  rather than something i chose  the perm  physical  energy risk mgt  group just got a couple of analysts to hack it together   including natasha danilochkina   then asked me to tidy it up when it didn  t  work  they are going to use their existing faulty model for now  to meet  their project deadlines   and i  m sketching out a proper mathematical spec  for the problem   i  ve persuaded    them that this sort of business  critical system should be  developed properly by research  and they now seem happy to fall into line   their wilton plant optimizer was developed by one peter morawitz  the guy i  hoped to recruit into research  and they obviously didn  t realise he was  better than average at quantitative modelling  anyway they now accept that  doing it properly will take months rather than weeks  and i  ll have a freer  hand in my choice of modelling tool  so a chat with tom would be extremely  valuable   cheers   steve  enron capital is  this an internal enron or external presentation  if external  i would say it  is just at the limit before sliding into proprietary stuff  perhaps that  s  why you  ve neatly almost entirely avoided questions about discounting and  risk  neutrality or lack of it   regards   grant ,0

 vince and vasant   here is a brief summary of my meeting with chris germany  capacity trader at  the east desk  related to gas transmission   typically  pipelines lease capacity billed on a monthly basis  an example  might be the pipeline between south texas and brooklyn  where you might pay   12  00 per month per 10  000 decatherms of capacity   0  40 per day   a fixed  payment  variable charges are 6  for fuel costs   shrinkage   and 6  5  for  overhead expenses  a gas trader might call south texas and be quoted a  delivery price tomorrow of nymex   0  10   basis    and might call brooklyn  and be quoted a delivered price of nymex   0  25  the trader  s spread is   0  35  and variable costs of transmission are  0  125  so the trader would  offer the leaseholder of capacity up to  0  225 for firm capacity tomorrow   as for the distinction betweem firm and interruptible  the leaseholders have  an excellent knowledge of the firm  equivalent of interruptible capacity   also  many pipelines don  t discount firm capacity from the tariff maximum    it  s not worth their time to haggle    there is a further issue of   secondary markets  not important to the model yet   for south texas and  brooklyn  there are several different routes the gas can physically take   pipelines of enron  texas eastern  etc   and  once the trade is in the  system traders can cover the  enron  positions on each end of the pipeline   in so doing freeing up the capacity for other contracts   clayton,0

 re  working gas price model  vince   i have a simplified version of brad  s model in mind   the  no arbitrage  condition equates trading margins across the country   costs of transmission rise with congestion on the network  wellhead supply is  almost completely price  elastic  while burner  tip demand is almost  completely price inelastic  storage is rationalized as a perpetual call  option   the least time  variant parameters are the costs of injecting and withdrawing  gas from storage to the pipeline  followed by the costs of delivering gas  from the wellhead to the pipeline  the intermediate  variant parameters are  the capacity  dependent costs paid to the pipeline  above shrinkage  for  transmission  the most time  variant parameters are the trading margins and  the valuations of the storage option   there are 8 parameters to be estimated at each major node of the betwork   they are identifiable in either of two straightforward ways  using a short  time series of the last 3 days prices based on the assumed variability  mentioned above  or point  estimates   calibrations   using only today  s data  based on a node  based model of competition between pipelines where pipes with  the same region of origination  albeit markedly different terminus  price  versus capacity similarly   competing  for outflows   i will write this up for you in scientific word and present it to you at your  earliest convenience   clayton,0

wrong or missing please let me  know  please don  t share the attached spreadsheet with anyone outside of  enron   regards   tim  new cap specifics  on 10  26  2000 the iso board passed a motion by a vote of 13  10 to implement a  new price cap methodology   the new methodology will become effective 11  3  2000 or as soon thereafter as  can be implemented  caiso staff has indicated that it will be difficult to  achieve that start date  they have not yet indicated what an achievable date  might be   the new price cap methodology will remain in place until   comprehensive market changes have been implemented and the market has proven  to be workably competitive under a variety of load conditions   either ferc or the iso board orders its removal   cap prices will be based on the average nymex l 3 d settlement average and the  following heat rate table   load level heat rate 4  00 gas example cap  40 gw  250  mwh  250  mwh  caps will be rounded up to the nearest  5  mwh increment   demand bids and demand responsiveness programs are exempt from these caps   the iso will post the price caps for each load level at least 48 hours prior  to the beginning of each calendar month  based on the iso  s two day  ahead  system load forecast  the iso will post hourly caps at least 24 hours prior  to the hour of delivery   ferc context  ferc has delegated cap authority to the caiso until 11  15  2000   the iso has asserted that they don  t need ferc authority since it is a bid  cap rather than a sales cap  ferc regulates sales  not purchases  of  electricity and therefore can regulate sales prices but not purchase prices   the iso has filed with ferc for an extension of the price cap authority   ferc has to rule on the filing by 11  18  2000   note that this is 3 days  after their authority expires   ferc will release its proposed order on 11  1  2000 based on the results of its  206 investigation of the california wholesale power markets  we don  t know  what they will find or what they will propose   the proposed order will have a 30 day comment period  after which ferc will  likely issue a final order  ferc will be accepting oral comments on  11  9  2000 in washington  enron still has to determine who will provide oral  comments   many companies have filed at ferc advocating or opposing a litany of price  caps  cost based rates  and market redesign recommendations   it is likely that the price caps approved by the iso board will go into  effect  how long they will remain in effect will depend on whether ferc  extends the iso price cap authority and whether the final order stemming from  the current 206 investigation stipulates a specific price cap policy   impact of price caps  the attached spreadsheet contains a table of likely maximum monthly prices at  different gas price levels  we think that this is the highest that markets  would clear since it assumes that each hour clears at the cap  it is hard to  say whether actual prices would clear significantly lower than the cap  because we don  t know whether sellers will offer below the cap or at the  cap  the assumptions behind our analysis are detailed in the bullets below   take actual historical loads from 1999 and 2000   calculate implied price cap for each hour using actual historical load  new  price cap methodology  and a range of gas prices   divide historical hours into peak and off  peak buckets   calculate average price for each month for peak hours and off  peak hours   for example  we have two years worth of data for the months of january  through september  each month has approximately 400 hours  for january  through september  we took approximately 800 observations for each month  400  from each year  and calculated a simple average of all of the individual  observations   we created a peak table and an off  peak table  the table shows the  calculated implied cap based off of the acutal loads at varying gas prices  for each month  this value represents what the month would clear at if each  hour cleared at the cap  based on historic loads   while any given hour  could be above this value  our calculation estimates the likely monthly  average cap value   the blue shading indicates what the caps would be given current  10  27  2000  nymex  forward prices  the yellow shading indicates those forward power  prices which are in excess of the proposed cap ,0

with caida  vince and stinson may want to  wait until kc claffy or i can visit portland  or have several enron  reps visit san diego for demos and related discussions   we have been talking to stan hanks for some time about enron  s  interests in passive measurement and are in the process of implementing  some of the performance features in coralreef that he has described as  relevant to enron  examples of existing coralreef analyses on oc 3  12  links can be found at    real  time   https    anala  caida  org  aix    post  processed traces   we are also working to better tune the skitter tool for reachability  analysis and for use by providers  an example of some existing  analyses can be found at  for end  to  end measurements  including those relating to service level  guarantees  we are working to make skping and sktrace more useful to  providers and their noc personnel  see  another tool of relevance to providers is our cflowd which analyzes  flow export data from cisco routers  see  http    www  caida  org  tools  cflowd    we would appreciate the opportunity to talk with enron personnel about  how to make these tools more relevant and useful to your needs   however

draft  of its charter is appended below  it focuses on producing educational  material about network measurement  and on developing new metrics  these  were the two areas of greatest interest amongst the caida members   the wg co  chairs are  sue moon  sprintlabs  and brett watson  mfn  abovenet   you are invited to attend the first wg meeting   the agenda is as follows    agenda for caida wg

metric definitions through ippm or rtfm   produce document  measurement requirements for hardware  software  vendors   publish on caida web pages  appendix a  questions from the earlier draft caida wg charters  a  what types of network  and transport  layer metrics are being  used by isps in engineering and operating their networks   by customers for verifying service guarantees   b  what new services are being  or are likely to be  offered  e  g   diffserv  is there a need for higher  layer metrics to better  monitor and manage these services   c  will these new differentiated transport  and  application  layer services need new metrics   d  how can the service metrics be measured in a multi  isp  environment   e  how can customers verify these measurements   f  what requirements would service measurement introduce for  equipment vendors   g  how relevant are specific techniques  e  g  which flow  and  points of measurement to specific users  isp  customer  etc    requirements   h  how do these metrics relate to network behavior as perceived  by users  how do they correlate with performance   appendix b  background on the ietf working groups   rtfm wg  realtime traffic flow measurement  rtfm is concerned with passive measurements of two  way traffic flows   specified in terms of their end  point attributes  its primary goal was  to produce an improved traffic flow measurement model considering at least the  following needs   a  wider range of measurable quantities  e  g  those  relating to ipv 6  and to class of service  b  simpler ways to specify flows of interest  c  better ways to control access to measured flow data  d  strong focus on data reduction capabilities  e  efficient hardware implementation   ippm wg  ip performance measurement  the ippm wg charter is to develop a set of standard metrics that can  be applied to the quality  performance  and reliability of internet  data delivery services  these metrics will be designed such that they  can be performed by network operators  end users  or independent  testing groups  it is important that the metrics not represent a value  judgement  i  e  define  good  and  bad    but rather provide unbiased  quantitative measures of performance   rfcs  framework for ip performance metrics  rfc 2330   metrics   connectivity  rfc 2678    one  way delay  rfc 2679   one  way packet loss  rfc 2680   round  trip delay  rfc 2681   i  ds  bulk transfer capacity  2 x   instantaneous packet delay variation  one  way loss patterns   other wgs  the rmonmib wg is thinking about  application performance  measurement   this is clearly a hard problem  e  g  does this just  mean response  time measurement  can it be done by passive means  how  should the measurements be presented  etc     in short   rtfm provides a good distributed measuring system for traffic  volumes   ippm has concentrated on transport  layer behaviour of the  current  best  effort internet    rmonmib is beginning to consider application  layer measurement       end of forwarded message     ,0

 the lure of the san  network world fusion focus  amy larsen decarlo  on storage in the enterprise  today  s focus  the lure of the san  03  14  00  dear wincenty kaminski   today  s focus  the lure of the san  by amy larsen decarlo  e  business is changing how businesses value information  information  has become a strategic asset that gives companies an edge over their  market rivals  companies use intelligence to identify new markets and  make contact with prospective customers  in this media  saturated era   information itself is packaged and sold as a product  this makes the  ability to supply users with fast access to stored information on a  continuous basis absolutely crucial   companies are clearly coming to a crossroads in their storage  implementations  with estimates for internet storage capacity needs  doubling every three months  it professionals are hungry for a scalable  solution to help them consolidate control of stored information  they  often look to storage  area networks  san  as a better option to manage  their information storage systems than distributed models   today  most organizations rely on a distributed storage model that uses  file servers to process i  o requests from end users and other  application servers  in this model  all requests for data go through  the file server that owns the attached storage disks  and only one file  server can tap data on a particular disk via a scsi bus   this model has several shortcomings  first  the amount of data a  server can access is restricted to the number of disks supported by the  bus  which limits the capacity of a single file server  second  because  the server processes each i  o request  it risks becoming a bottleneck   third  this server model carries some daunting availability limitations   because only one file server is allowed to access a set of disks  if  that file server or any of its scsi connections fails  then users and  other application servers lose access to the stored files   this model carries other major disadvantages  distributed file servers  rely on the data transport network to run backup and recovery operations  which can eat up bandwidth and slow normal network transmissions to a  crawl  finally  this decentralized setup is difficult to manage from  both a logical and a physical perspective  file server based storage  systems are distributed throughout the enterprise  so it is often  difficult to assess current and future capacity needs  and because  these servers use a parallel cabling scheme to link the file server to  the disk array  they can also be cumbersome to set up and manage   sans promise to mitigate the problems that plague conventional file  servers  largely through consolidation of control  these specialized  storage networks claim higher availability  faster performance   centralized management  and by their architecture  the capability to  remove bandwidth  intensive data backup and recovery operations from the  lan  this frees up the lan for normal data communications and ensures  smoother back  up operations   using high  speed transports like fibre channel  sans offer a high   performance network optimized for moving storage data  sans also make  way for new storage implementations like lan  free backup  and  because  fibre channel can support distances of up to 10 kilometers  san devices  can be widely distributed  but also centrally managed as one network   yet  as was the case with lans in their younger years  sans are still  developing  vendors are still working out major product interoperability  issues  while companies deploying san technology struggle with how to  merge the very different worlds of storage and networks and manage both  together  ultimately the hope is that  like lans  sans will develop into  a mature and highly manageable solution that supplies substantial  benefits at lower costs   given that storage deployment and ongoing support costs can total 10  times the acquisition price for the equipment  the consolidated  management capabilities of a san may deliver the biggest benefit to  business   to contact amy larsen decarlo

 re  gwen koepke  anne   thanks for contacting me about this   as a matter of fact  i wanted to talk to you about it  today as this matter was outstanding for a long time   i think we should go ahead and adjust gwen to manager   effective march 1  the compensation would be her current base plus  10 k  this is what we typically do when we promote an associate to a manager   such promotions take place in march and i think  gwen should not be penalized for the inefficiency of her management   i  e  my and maureen  s procrastination    on unrelated and more serious matter  gary hickerson is the primary client  for maureen  s services  he communicated to me a few weeks ago that he is  unwilling to underwrite maureen  s position  he is in general unhappy with  her contribution   this means that maureen will have to find another sponsor  or leave enron   given her abrasive and aggressive personality finding another internal  customer  will be quite a challenge   gary volunteered to pay a very generous severance to maureen from his budget   i would like to talk to you about it when you have a few minutes   vince  from  anne labbe  enron  enronxgate on 05  02  2001 10  34 am  to  vince j kaminski  hou  ect  ect  cc   subject  gwen koepke  vince   just wanted to touch base with you  i have tried to contact maureen so that  gwen  s title and salary can be adjusted to manager just as you requested  but  have not heard any response from her  would you like for me to wait until i  hear from maureen or should i go ahead and proceed in changing her title  i  just want to make sure that gwen is in the right peer group during prc   also  i am going to try and set up a meeting with you next week through  shirley to discuss any buring issues that you are experiencing  and your  expectations during prc   thanks   anne,0

 re  equity investment fair value in turkey  john   it seems to me that using a risk  free rate is not appropriate  i shall  elaborate on my  position and send you a longer message this afternoon  my time    vince  enron capital  trade resources corp   europe  from  john bottomley 06  19  2000 05  55 am  to  vince j kaminski  hou  ect  ect  cc  john sherriff  lon  ect  ect  dale surbey  lon  ect  ect  subject  equity investment fair value in turkey  vince   john sherriff recommended that i contact you regarding an interesting  and  potentially contentious  option valuation issue we are currently dealing with  in london  we hold longish term options in a private company in turkey which  is currently seeking to ipo  the issue we are discussing with rac is which  discount rate  i  e   risk  free  and if so turkish or us   should we use to  value these options  first  some additional information   option characteristics     116  000 options  representing 9  of the company     term  minimum of 3 years but possibly longer   still being renegotiated    strike price  20  below the upcoming ipo price  either priced in us  or  turkish lire   we currently hold the above number of options with a fixed price of  118  75  per option but 34  800 expire on july 15  2000 with the remainder expiring on  december 15  2000  the company  s investment bankers  abn  amro rothchilds   are concerned regarding the strike price because it values the company at   118 million and they believe the company is worth approx  300 million  due  to such a large  valuation gap   they originally encouraged us to exercise  all of the options by the end of june  ipo target date in late sept  early  oct   our counter  proposal is to  swap  instrinsic value for time value by  repricing the options strike higher while extending their term   we are currently negotiating with rac the most appropriate discount rate to  use to value the options  we are arguing that the us risk free is the most  appropriate discount rate and their current position is that the company  s  historical senior debt cost  18   is the more appropriate number to use   although admit that this is not justifiable   only a proxy   a few key points     rac is valuing the options via crystal ball simulations such that this  to  be negotiated  discount rate is used to calculate the pv of the future  options intrinsic value in 3 years   i  e   for black  scholes  a higher discount rate yields a higher value but  the opposite is true using crystal ball simulation     the model simulates both an ipo  no ipo case and in the case of no ipo we  have put options for our equity priced at a fixed 17  return    the model assigns a 30  illiquidity discount    in the simulated cases where the options are out  of  the  money  we  obviously do not exercise   we understand that for black  scholes option valuation  one needs to be able  to construct a comparable portfolio of cash flows using equity futures and  the risk free in order for the valuation to hold  and here is where we reach  our difficulty  since the company doesn  t currently trade on a public market  and since equity futures do not exist for turkish equities  rac is arguing  that a us risk free is not appropriate to use  our argument is that the  non  ipo scenario  a 30  illiquidity discount and a us  based option  volatility are already in the factored into the simulation  as such  we feel  rac  s approach is double counting   if you managed to get through the above  your a patient man  i  ll give you a  call today or tomorrow after you  ve had a chance to digest the information   regards   john bottomley,0

 re  uk power  gas  vince  just fyi   oliver  risk control in london  was asking if it is appropriate to use a set  of factors corresponding to some commodity for another commodity   this  mapping  we do quite frequently in our var system when forward prices  for a commodity are not correlated  because of poor price history    i think using this kind of mappings is ok because we can not trust these  correlations based on illiquid price information   if we believed the matrix with low correlations represents what goes on in  the market and we simply can not reconstruct it with our 7 factors  then  we might use more factors then 7 or the matrix itself   tanya  tanya tamarchenko  12  15  2000 02  36 pm  to  oliver gaylard  lon  ect  ect  cc  david port  market risk  corp  enron  enron  rudi

completely agree with you  validating var inputs like positions  prices and  volatilities which are used by risktrac is the first thing to do   you also rise a valid question  if the factor loadings for some commodity do  not make sense should we use the factor loadings for another commodity   the factor loadings  do not make sense  when the correlations across the term  structure are not high  so if we believe that the forward prices for this  commodity are market prices and statistical analysis on these prices produces  the correlations which we trust  then it would be proper to use this  correlation matrix in var engine  not the factors  using factors is simply  the way to speed up calculations for highly correlated prices without  sacrificing the accuracy   tanya   oliver gaylard  12

tanya tamarchenko  hou  ect  ect   ganapathy ramesh  hou  ect  ect  debbie r brackett  hou  ect  ect  subject  re  uk power  gas  naveen  regarding the calculation of uk vars in risk trac i agree that we should be  using this calculation engine for all commodity vars  however we should not  focus solely on the uk but ensure that we use risk trac for continental power  and gas  uk power and gas  nordic power   to use risk trac i think the following need to be resolved first  to  implement it  right the first time   as i think it is incorrect to consider  the risk trac numbers  as the most accurate  since it depends on the validity  of these items   positions  delta and gamma  and curve mapping  these need to include all  positions including those outside the main risk systems  positions  curves and mapping should now be no problem given the feeds   apart from continental power  have been uat  d and we have the spreadsheet  feeds up and running   price and vol curves  as used by the risk systems  as above  inter commodity correlation  prompt month  correlation should be easy to calculate given an accurate and complete data  set  however the incomplete historic data for europe in risk trac  prior to  the formation of the task force  would mean a full data set needs to be  obtained and used   term structure of correlation would be good but i  understand this is difficult to use in the calculation   factor loadings  i think factor loadings should be calculated  on the same data sets used  for inter commodity correlation  for all commodities  if this analysis does  not appear to work i am not sure that using factor loadings for other markets  is adequate  do we need to consider an alternative approach to calculating  var for these markets   to ensure this moves forward i think a list of the mile stones   responsibilities and time lines needs to be drawn up otherwise i fear the  process of moving across to risk trac from the spreadsheet var will  experience some slippage   i will call today to start the process off   rgds  oliver  naveen andrews  enron  06  12  2000 21  50  to  oliver gaylard  lon  ect  ect  cc  david port  market risk  corp

ect  subject  uk power  gas  oliver   i had a couple of issues pertaining to uk power  uk gas  first   just a few notes as it pertains to risk trac uk  implementation    1  in risktrac  currently all the gas curves are mapped to nbp    2  all the power curves are mapped to r 4  cinergy    factor loading analysis lends itself only to nbp and the norewgian curves  for  reasons of liquidity  etc   we have decided that nbp and cinergy are the  best curves available at this time   the spreadsheet which is utilized in the uk also has curves mapped to a  2  3  year old set of factors derived from us nat gas  which is clearly not  optimal  hence   1  we should be using risktrac numbers for var  as it is the  most  accurate   both in terms of ene  wide model usage and in terms of the most  recent updated data  ever since uk power came on board in risktrac 3 weeks  ago  the uk power number has been consistently 7  8 mm above the numbers in  your spreadsheet  this difference is to be ecpected  given the different  inputs    2  the consistent numbers do not point to a data error in any obvious way   however  if you believe that positions are not captured correctly  please let  our it staff know that    3  checks which ramesh has done indicate that positions are tying in   however  as you know  there could be disconnects with enpower  etc   in any event  it would be ideal and optimal to have all the simulations run  out of risktrac for reasons of aggregation and analysis   your help is appreciated   regards  naveen,0

 re  spreadsheet for george posey  vince   here is an analysis of the fund giving at the church   first off  it appears from the data that a special  appeal  for fund giving  was made  from the pulpit   on april 19  1998 and april 25  1999   perhaps  tied rhetorically into income taxes    then  by going back and incorporating  obvious dates from the calendars for 1997  1999  the following regression  analysis is made  where each effect is added independently   giving this sunday   4403   a minor  3 weekly time trend  i  e   multiply by the number of weeks since  jan  5  1997    no pure effect from last week  s contributions  i  e   denies first  order  autoregressive effects     2426 if easter sunday or the sunday nearest christmas    9695 if  pastoral appeal  april 19  1998 or april 25  1999    340 if the sunday falls on the weekend of a monday federal holiday    50 if the sunday following thanksgiving    73 if a summer weekend  june 1 thru august 31   the pure time trend is very small  so an annual projection based on all 3  years data would be for giving to increase only a minor amount   150  for  2000 assuming a similar appeal for giving is made this april   clayton,0

 re   joe   i have written to pal quilkey to invite christian werner to houston  for a week to discuss how much of his research we can use   vince  joseph hrgovcic  08  01  2000 06  51 pm  to  vince j kaminski  hou  ect  ect  mike a roberts  hou  ect  ect  cc   subject   vince   i have inquired into christian  s climate models  it seems to me like a long  term project  chiristian says that his model might be able to do better than  the australian met given that they ignore some of the variables he uses and  that they are an  old boy  s network  resistant to new developments  but i  don  t think the same can be said of most other weather services  as far as  the nws goes  they run their model on a cray  they have several very talented  phd  s working on it full  time  and even then  they can only get a dozen or  so runs per night  in other words  it  s a huge system  replicating something  even close to that will not be an easy task   that being said  i think there are related applications that we could look  into  since i  ve already promised the rac group and the weather desk  s pjm  traders to put together a vector autoregressive model of daily temperatures   i think it makes sense to see if something better than a var model can be put  together  perhaps a very stripped down version of the kind of model christian  has  what i have in mind is something that would give us say  up to several  dozens of  possible  temperature forecasts every morning  which would be  calculated using actual climate models  as opposed to time series models   i  would not use this as a forecasting tool  the nws model results would make a  far better  best guess    but our ensemble could still be used to provide a  distribution of temperature scenarios  this ensemble would have several uses   1  we could price the book for the ensemble of runs and thereby obtain a  more realistic daily v  r for the weather book  and eventually interface that  with the power desk  s v  r calculations   2  we could use the ensemble of forecasts to relate temperature forecasts to  week  ahead cdd and hdd distributions  for use in our demand swaps   3  if freese  notis were to give us one of their qualitative forecasts   e  g    expect the trough to recede  we could sort through the different monte  carlo scenarions  find one in which the trough in question is receding  and  use corresponding output statistics to download the actual temperatures  corresponding to that scenario  up till now  we haven  t found a good way of  getting a numerical fix on what different forecasts actually mean  temperature  wise  4  we could use the associated visualization routines that come with such  models to get animations of the evolution of historical weather patterns  the  traders could use these in order to look for historical periods which roughly  match current weather conditions and get an idea of what could happen   although these meteorological models would not be good for simulating  month  ahead or season  ahead weather  trust me on this  we could still use the  visualization technology to do to analogous seasonal animations   just today  i  ve spoken with dr  jacobsen of stanford university  who has  written one of the more recent textbooks on climate forecasting  and who  worked with ucla  s general circulation model  he says that getting a  simplified version of mm 5  which is itself a simplified  limited  area version  of the gcm models that nws  cola  and ucla use  would take several months to  implement  assuming the people involved are already well versed in the  technology  also  i have contacted aer  a massachusetts  based weather  consulting firm  and they tell me that they have a mm 5 model running daily   only one run per night   and also some smaller pc models up and running   they are of course willing to work with us for a fee  their mm 5 version runs  on a  200  000 parallel processor   i am open to your suggestions  or objections as the case may be   i  m not  sure how the costs would be apportioned given that this would benefit all of  enron  and not just the weather desk   i am scheduled to go to boston next week anyway  and would like to use the  opportunity to visit with aer  i will of course coordinate any projects with  christian  if we get something like this up and running it will be more  likely that he can get the computing power he needs to run his own australian  model    joe,0

 london research group  john   i am writing to you regarding the management of the london research group   as you know  dale surbey  who was managing the london unit of the research  group   is moving to ebs  dale did a terrific job helping me to develop the pool of  talent we have currently  in london   given that dale is likely to be transfered to houston  it  s time  to nominate one member of the research group for a management position   my recommendation is steve leppard  steve emerged not only as the most  technically qualified member of the group but also as a natural leader   highly  respected by his peers and internal customers  steve has a very high energy  level  and is very efficient as a manager and as coach of new talent   his promotion is likely to cause anjam  s departure form enron  i value  technical  skills of anjam  but in spite of my loyalty to him  don  t think he is the  same caliber  as steve  however  i would not like to lose him and think about moving him to  houston  for 2 years  i think that the opportunity to work in houston  would be a  sufficient  incentive to keep him in enron  by the way  his performance feedback has  greatly improved   please  let me know what you think   vince,0

 ethylene margin collar simulation model  i set up the simulation model  the margin follows a mean  reverting process   i seperarted the data into two category  margin  0  04 and margin  0  04   then i estimate the mean reverting speed seperately for these two data sets   i got higher mean reverting speed than that i estimated using the whole data  set   the high mr speed surpresses the probability at high payout side   since the mr speed is sensitive to where i divide the data  so bob will run  a few senarios   i put the overal settlement cap and floor into the montly premium  calculation  so the  the result in el 8 on the summary page is the ultimate answer to the deal  pricing   i also calculate the undiscounted payout distribution and overall collar  worth   relax the overall cap and floor will have a direct comparison with the spread  option  approach that bob and lee set up   look like we got a reasonable model   stinson   i  d like to have you check my set up for the simulation model   lee and douglas   you can play with the model  and let me know what do you think   bob   we need run different price curve senarios using the simulation model   plus different mr speed   zimin,0

 friday brown bag on derivative pricing  hello all   if you think any of your people would be interested in the following  please  pass the messages on   thanks                                          message one  dear everyone   we understand the as members of enron research group  all of us are working  on very interesting projects  some of which are ground  breaking  and we all  keep a very keen mind on any development of new technology  we also find  out  through our own experience  that at this age of information explosion   it becomes more and more difficult to have enough time and energy to keep  abreast with most of the exciting stuff taking place in this department  let  alone in the industry  it is also our personal experience that many a  project we are working on has partially been attempted by other members of  this group   as a remedy  we propose that the research group start an informal brown bag  lunch group meeting  once every two weeks on friday  for about 50 minutes   it is hoped that it will provide a forum for us to facilitate with new  technology and development  as well as with each other   s work  so that we do  not have to reinvent the wheels   we envision the following  in this meeting  or seminar   each one of us will  take turns to make presentations to the group  the topics could range from  theoretical consideration to practical implementation  be it option pricing   process modelling  insurance issue  or monte carlo simulation  or anything  one finds fascinating  the presentation material could be papers you have  been reading recently  projects you are working on  some problem that  bothers you  or an idea that is fascinating  you choose your own  presentation style  it could be  everything  you  always  wanted  to  know  but  were  afraid  to  ask  hand waving  style  or it can involve nitty  gritty  detailed derivations  anyway a style  that suits you and the topic  or it can simply be a dry  run for your  presentation at the next risk conference  zimin and alex will take upon the  responsibility of organizing the seminar   we hope the seminar will be up and running in two  three weeks  for that  purpose your support will be greatly appreciated  please let either zimin or  alex know if you are interested in giving a presentation to the group and  provide a tentative schedule  surely the rest of the group will be happy to  hear your presentation   we encourage everyone to participate this brown bag meeting  either to give a  talk or just sit in   zimin lu  alex huang  message two  dear everyone   it looks like the proposed bblop has great support and is to have a great  start  vince  grant   amitava  kevin  clayton and chonawee have promised  to give presentations to us  vince will kindly deliver the inaugural  presentation next friday  march 31  on new methodology for option pricing   precise title  tba   bblop will start at 12 noon and last about 45 to 50 minutes  let  s  make this a new enron tradition   best regards   zimin   alex,0
 re  the consultant  s model for gary hickerson  s group  the model is supposed to be a real option model to capture the value of  power plants of gencos  it is to give trader a better insight as to whether  the  market is overvaluing  undervaluing certain genco stocks  and trader can  act accordingly  i  m still trying to find out how trader is supposed to use  it   modeling details   the model takes in all gencos  locational power forward prices and fuel  forward  prices  and uses garch model to simulate one year daily prices  and then  uses a hourly profile to convert them into hourly prices  garch model  parameters  are estimated by the consultant using and separate model and  are updated twice a year  and it does not matter whether the simulation starts  in january or september   using these prices  it will determine whether a unit at a particular location  will be dispatched  or not depending on a  spread of power and fuel prices  and b  whether the  start  up  cost can be recovered during 8 operation hours  the unit can be dispatched at  minimum and peak levels  fixed o  m  sox and nox  i don  t know what the last  two stand for   are taken into consideration   with the simulated dispatch schedule  the model calculates the value that can  be generated  by this unit  then sums it up across all units   the final value is the average of 100 simulations  and it takes about 16  hours to run for about  200 units   after our conversation  the consultant promised to look into a  how to make  the model more flexible   say  to allow a different time horizon  b  reduce spreadsheet overhead by  doing calculation one  unit a time and not saving all the intermediate information  as of now it  saves everything  on the spreadsheet    assuming the garch process is modelled correctly  i believe the methodology  is ok  though  it does not capture most of the optionality   my concerns are   whether the price processes are modelled correctly  i have to get more  details before making  any conclusion   100 simulations are way too few  unless we convert the algorithm to c  i  don  t see how spreadsheet  can handle more simulations  i guess that  s why they contact us  but again   if enron  s buying the  model from the consulting company  why should enron do their job for them   how trader  s going to use the model output  for this i phoned jeff  the  associate who initiated all  these  and am still waiting for his returning call  a related questions why  the model horizon is one year   we can either  oversee the conversation  but not doing actual coding for them   or  redo the model for them   the problem still remains that how trader  s going  to use the output   but  in view of the great wall of china separating the business units  should we  do it   as of now i have a simulation model taking start  up cost  fixed o  m  rump  up  delay into consideration   it simulates monthly prices  using gbm  and takes 2 minutes 40 seconds to run  10  000 simulations for  one unit for ten years  120 time steps   it can use forward  forward vol and  incorporate seasonality into  it  i understand this is debatable    one interesting observation is that  when using forward  forward vol  simulation  the standard deviation is about 0  5   while standard deviation  using forward vol is about  2   also  incorporating seasonality increases the value by about 1  6    since  most of the time  cost  occurs in price simulation  and we are to simulate about 20 price processes   i hope the full model   if we build it  will take a couple of hours to run for 200 units  the main  task will be interfacing  i  e    getting data from data base  and outputting the results  this is where i need  most help if i am to do it   please advice the course of action  i am supposed to talk to michelle  cisneros today   p  s  i never promised to oversee a programmer in our group  see the message  below    best   alex                        forwarded by alex

 just fyi  vince   please see below some of the ideas being bounced  fyi  please keep this  confidential   the unused capacity in maharashtra should be dispatched on a merchant basis   on behalf of mseb to any customers outside mseb  s current purview  i would  like us to look at the whole issue as one of mseb  s poor credit  and hence   as jeff pointed out on the call   one where we need to identify all deep  pockets in and out of maharashtra   secondly  there is  as shubh and i had pointed out  the ability to evacuate  about 700  1000 mw to customers other than mseb  the challege is  at what  price  and in coordination with which agencies  as always  in india your  greatest challenge will be in dealing with govt  agencies   another point to consider is that in  all we have about 5  7 customers  identified  will all the customers we have earmarked bite    this is the  reason why systems need to be set up with a bulletin board on pricing 10  15  day power on the screens of the different sebs we can connect up with  this  also substantially gets around the credit quality issue  as this would be an  arrangement akin to cash  and  carry  i see a lot of hope for such a  strategy  i do not see much hope for a strategy of selling blocks of power  to either ntpc or ptc  i would agree however  that we not put all our eggs  in one basket  and hence you could designate a team to look into the ntpc  sale issue inparallel   in order to set up the trading sytems  however  we need to start by the end  of ql 2001  and just start doing small deals where we break even  simply to  test the waters and introduce liquidity into the market   hand  in  hand with this we need a fuel risk management strategy  as i have  been pushing for  for this to happen  we need to get the special import  licence reinstated  if that is not possible  we need to lobby with the  highest authorities within govt  and rbi to allow for hedging  irrespective  of whether we have an sil  the discussions being held with ioc are therefore  very important in this regard  and i am going to get anshuman and mukesh  involved with the same   finally  i do not see much hope for your strategy of asking ene management  for  75 million to build transmission lines in a country where the regulatory  framework on transmission access is even less defined and understood than the  generation side of the equation  i would refrain from stating this in any  senior management forum until we are able to clearly demonstrate the  cost  benefit of this  i have some ideas on that side which i need to develop  further   regards   sandeep ,0

 sharad agnihotri  telephone chat following the offer  hi kate   thanks for setting up the telephone informal discussion with sharad so that i  can make him more comfortable with what  s on offer  i really think it will  make the difference  as you mentioned  the agency fee goes up from 25  to  30  at 50  000  hence the offer of 49  000  i guess  as you mentioned  we can  keep in reserve the possibility of an element of sign on bonus to get him  over the decision hump   regards  thanks   anjam,0
 re  sorry   chonawee   this was perfectly all right  as a matter of fact i expect and encourage  the members of the group to disagree with me  or anybody else   on any subject  i am never offended by it and take it as a manifestation  of ability to think independently and having the courage of one  s  convictions   nobody has the monopoly on truth and nobody knows everything  the only  way we can learn and avoid costly errors  to ourselves and the  company  is by having open communication  in enron   facts are friendly   by the way  it was an excellent presentation   vince  chonawee supatgiat  enron  01  04  2001 03  10 pm  to  vince j kaminski  hou  ect  ect  cc   subject  sorry   hi vince  i am sorry for correcting on the revenue of the different auctions   vickrey 1961 showed that all 4 kinds of auctions would yield the same  expected revenue to the auctioneer   dutch  english  first price  sealed bid   and second  price sealed bid   in fact  the selling price is equal to the  valuation of the second highest bidder  for example  in vickrey auction   everyone bids at his own valuation  hence  the winner pays the valuation of  the second highest bidder  in english auction  the second highest valuation  bidder will stop competing if the price is above his valuation  hence  the  winner also gets the item at the price of the second highest valuation bidder   thank you for attending the meeting and giving many helpful contributions    chonawee,0

 jcc  good morning  i apologize for the response delay  i  ve gone back through  the analysis that i did back in april  and have thrown around some ideas with  vince and stinson  the issue may be summarized as follows   the hedge relationship was derived using jcc and prompt brent  and is valid  for jcc and prompt brent  no problems here  however  it will not be valid  for points far out on the forward curve  intuitively  this hedge  relationship will approach one as we move far out on the curve  but since  there is no data  i can not statistically determine this  one can imagine a  term structure of heding ratios that start at 0  67 and move to 1  0  so that  the back end of the curves would move together  but how fast it converges to  one is anyone  s guess   if there is a way of determining the historical jcc forward curve  then the  hedge relationships may be estimated  however  i have been unable to  determine a rigorous approach to building the jcc curve   i can explain this far better in person  and would like to talk as soon as  possible at your convenience    kevin kindall,0

friday apr 27 2001  dpc board empowers md to cancel mseb contract  the enron power project crisis on thursday deepened with the board of dabhol  power company authorising the management to issue a termination notice to the  maharashtra state electricity board even while international lenders to the  project asked enron to renegotiate power purchase agreement signed with the  mseb   the decision to authorise managing director neil mcgregor to issue  notice of  termination on the contract to sell 740 mw of power  was taken after the  board prevented mseb from voting on the ground that it was an interested  party  the decision was taken with six votes in favour and the single  opposition vote was cast by idbi  sources said   according to reports  financial institutions such as anz investment bank   credit suisse first boston  citibank  abn  amro and the state bank of india  have on wednesday advised enron against terminating its ppa with mseb  mseb  chairman vinay bansal  who with two other directors attended the meeting on  wednesday representing maharashtra   s 15 per cent stake in the near  3  billion  project  said   the indian side told them that it would be unfortunate if  enron broke the contract   while bansal declined comment on the board  decision  the sources said the indian side had expressed its interest to  holds talks on the issue rather than terminating the project and there were  possibilities of a fresh power purchase agreement between the company and the  state   pti   the economic times  friday apr 27 2001  mseb pays rs 134 cr under  protest  to dpc  despite the threat of a possible termination notice hanging on its head   maharashtra state electricity board on thursday made a  protest payment  of  rs 134 crore disputed amount  towards march bill of rs 146  64 crore to  dabhol   we were ready with the payment on wednesday itself  but dpc  officials could not collect the cheque due to the statewide bandh   a senior  mseb official said   we have disputed payment of rs 12  64 crore and it would  be now taken up at the disputes resolution forum  of which enron india  managing director k wade cline and krishna rao are members   mseb sources  said   last week  dpc had dashed off a communication to the government and mseb that  it would not accept  protest payments  anymore  cline had said the energy  major shall treat such payments as an election to pay the sums  which mseb in  fact owed dpc in full and that the company would also not recognise the   purported protest or reservation   mseb had paid a rs 113  5 crore february  bill in protest last month  on april 23 last  both domestic and international  lenders of dpc had met in london and held exhaustive discussions the  multinational  s move to issue a termination notice to mseb and state  government   pti   business standard  friday  april 27  001  enron india md authorised to terminate ppa  the board of the enron  promoted dabhol power company  dpc   at its meeting in  london on wednesday  authorised the managing director of enron india to issue  a notice for terminating the power purchase agreement to the maharashtra  state electricity board and the state government    the board has authorised  wade cline to serve the termination notice  however  this does not mean that  the termination notice will be served immediately  it is only an enabling  provision and will be used only if the situation arises   8 a state government  source told business standard from london  he said dpc was under pressure  from its lenders   the dpc spokesperson here refused to comment on the issue  the hardening of  the board   s stand is in sharp contrast to the advice of dpc  s lenders  who  had warned enron not to precipitate matters by issuing a termination notice   the lenders had arrived at a consensus that the termination notice need not  be served at this stage  serving of the notice requires a nod from the  lenders  who have an exposure of about  2 billion in the project  sources  said given the lenders  strong opposition to termination of the contract  the  enron board  s  enabling resolution  did not have much significance beyond  conveying a hardening of its stand with regard to the current imbroglio  the  maharashtra chief minister had warned enron not to scuttle the process of  crisis resolution by issuing a termination notice  the state government is to  nominate an expert group to renegotiate the terms of the dabhol contract   enron holds 65 per cent in dpc  while us  based ge and bechtel hold 10 per  cent each  the balance 15 per cent is held by mseb through a special purpose  vehicle  maharashtra power development corporation  the mseb representatives  were not allowed to vote at the meeting since they were an interested party   the idbi representative protested against the board  s decision  the meeting  was attended by state energy secretary vm lal  the meeting was held against  the backdrop of a dispute between mseb and dpc over payment of bills   after mseb failed to pay rs 102 crore towards the december 2000 bill  dpc  invoked the state government  s guarantee and then the union government  s  counter guarantee  when payment of the rs 127  crore january bill became  overdue  dpc again invoked the state government  s guarantee  mseb retaliated  on january 28  2001 by slapping a rs 401  crore penalty for non  supply of  electricity at adequate levels  it demanded that dpc adjust the bills against  this penalty   this stand of mseb was explained to dpc at the board meeting    a state government official said  the centre also supported mseb  s stand and  refused to honour the counter guarantee  the power company then invoked the  political force majeure clause  a process of conciliation and arbitration  between the centre and dpc is currently on   the financial express  friday  april 27  2001  foreign lenders slam brakes on disbursements to dpc  sanjay jog  raghu mohan  global banks comfortable with enron pull  out  lenders to the dabhol power company  dpc  are a sharply divided lot   international lenders  in direct contrast to the stand taken by local ones  led by the the industrial develoment bank of india  idbi   are categorical  that additional assistance to dpc   s phase  ii will be held in abeyance despite  the completion of 92 per cent of the project work  the stage is also set for a  preliminary termination notice to be served by dpc to the maharashtra state  electricity board  mseb  within the next four weeks  this follows the  authorisation given to enron india   s managing director k wade cline and dpc  president  ceo neil mcgregor to serve the termination notice  and transfer  notices to mseb  following wednesday   s dpc board meeting in london   the essence of the message from the international lenders following the  london meeting with dpc board is  emotions do not work  contractual  obligations and payments have to be met  we are convinced that the mseb has  failed to meet its obligations  there is no point in enron continuing with  the project and the company should get out of it  the structuring of dpc   s  debt has created two classes of lenders  in phase  i  international lenders  are covered by a sovereign guarantee while in phase  ii  no lender is   however  all lenders have a parri passu charge  making attachment of assets a  messy affair   sources in international banks were quick to point out that local lenders to  phase  ii of the project are worried that an awry dpc project will affect  their interests more given that they have no security   other than assets    like a sovereign cover    it was this desperation that made local lenders like  idbi slash the interest rates a few months back to 16  5 per cent from 21  5  per cent   8 a leading foreign banker pointed out  three points that were made  clear and stressed in no uncertain terms by international lenders were  a   there are contractual obligations b  mseb was not punctual in its payments to  dpc and c  mseb adopted a confrontational position by slapping a rs 401 crore  rebate charge on dpc for misdeclaration and default on the availability of  power   while local lenders led by idbi   with mseb parroting the same   were of the  view that the current situation is a temporary one  international lenders  were steadfast that pulling out of the project is the only way out  this is  despite the stance taken by idbi and mseb that authorisation for termination  given to mr cline and mr mcgregor was not called for  international bankers  pointed out that they will now have to look at the issue of charges and  protection for their loans in the event of the power project being scrapped  in its present form  the points of contention are  a  that phase  i of dpc is  backed by a sovereign guarantee b  phase  ii is not and c  to the extent that  phase  ii is covered by assets  cancellation of phase  ii may see all assets    even those under phase  i   getting attached  therefore  an examination on the  segregation of assets under phase  i and phase  ii is now warranted   pti adds  in a significant move  dpc board has empowered its management to  sever power supply agreement with mseb  a move that could inflict a financial  liability of about rs 2840 crore on the centre  a decision to authorise dpc  president neil mcgregor to issue a termination notice to mseb for sale of  power was taken by the board at its meeting on wednesday   the indian express  friday  april 27  2001  enron  dabhol chief gets powers to end deal with the mseb  the board of dabhol power company  a subsidiary of houston  based enron corp   has decided to warn the maharashtra state electricity board  mseb  that it  intends to pull the plug on its guhagar  based project  in a board meeting held  in london on wednesday  the board decided to authorise dpc president and ceo  neil mcgregor and enron india   s managing director k wade cline to serve a      preliminary     termination notice for sale of power to the mseb within the  next four weeks  the dabhol project has been mired in disputes since mseb  began missing payments last year  mseb owes dabhol power  48 million for  power delivered in december and january  the payment ran into a dispute after  mseb slapped penalty notices of rs 401 crore on dpc for its failure to supply  power within three hours of the demand being placed  but mseb has paid  24  million for february  and a payment of  31 million was made for march on  thursday   the  3 billion dabhol project is the largest foreign investment made in india  to date  issuing the preliminary termination notice could enable dabhol to  suspend deliveries as it negotiates payment disputes  while a preliminary  termination notice is the first of three steps that could potentially lead to  the abandonment of the project by enron  analysts have described the decision  as a     procedural     move consistent with dpc   s negotiating strategy to  recover overdue payments from the mseb   after the company issues the preliminary termination notice  step two would  be an official termination notice  and step three would be a notice that the  company is surrendering control of the project  if the project is terminated   the government of india will have to take a hit of  300 million besides  paying bills of rs 1  500 crore for the next one year to enron as penalty       our  centre   s  liability  if dabhol power project is terminated  would be  one year   s electricity bill and a termination fee of  300 million      power  secretary a k basu said      contractually  the centre will have to pay one year    s electricity bill  totalling at present prices about rs 1  400  1  500 crore   and take over dpc   s debt  which stands at around  300 million  if the project  was terminated      basu said in delhi  dabhol power is in the process of  completing the second phase of the 2  184  megawatt power  plant project  which  is 95 per cent through   while the international lenders to the project are pressurising the company  to get out of the project  indian lenders  led by idbi  are asking the  company to reconsider its decision on its termination notice  during the  meeting in london  mseb which holds a 15 per cent stake in the project  had  strongly opposed dpc   s move to authorise cline and mcgregor to issue notices  for termination   mseb chairman vinay bansal and technical director prem paunikar   both  directors on the dpc board   and the state principal secretary  energy  vm  lal  an invitee to the board  raised the issue at the board meeting in  london  mseb claimed that dpc was needlessly     threatening     to issue various  arbitration notices and thereby interpreting the clauses of ppa in  isolation  in recent weeks  dabhol has raised the stakes in its spat with the  mseb  delivering a notice of political force majeure to maharashtra   a step  typically invoked to dissolve a contract in case of an emergency like a war   coup  or a similar radical political event  in this case  dpc   s move was  viewed as a threat to stop providing electricity  dpc has come under fire  because of the relatively high cost of its power  critics object to the  company charging rs 7  1 a kilowatt  hour for its power  compared with around  rs 1  5 a kilowatt  hour charged by other suppliers   the hindu  friday  april 27  2001  offer of renegotiation  too late   enron  by mahesh vijapurkar  mumbai  april 26  the enron  sponsored dabhol power company  which last night  authorised its local management to issue a notice of termination of its power  purchase agreement  ppa  with the maharashtra state electricity board  has  decided to keep a stiff upper lip  this  in turn  has stoked speculation that  the switching off of power from its phase i plant was imminent  while in  reality  a lengthy procedure has to be followed as prescribed within the ppa   as one source familiar with the ppa told the hindu    it is not sudden death  of the project   and in all probability  the dpc  vexed with the  developments  including sharp and pointed observations by the godbole  committee  has chosen to only arm itself with a serious option    this would  only eventually come into effect  it is not an overnight operation and a lot  of legal work is involved    apparently  the dpc intends to do some  arm  twisting   at the board of directors meeting in london  which maharashtra was initially  disinclined to attend but later used the forum to put across its contentions  on the project  the dpc squarely told the mseb nominees on the board that the  offer of renegotiation had come rather   too late    it also said it did not  see any room for optimism about the outcome  it did not  however  rule out  the option of talks  thus underscoring the possibility that the decision to  authorise termination was a new weapon   the maharashtra chief minister  mr  vilasrao deshmukh  had hoped that dpc  would not take any   harsh step   which would cause lot of damage to the  interests of both the independent power producer and the government and today  he expressed his dismay  in fact  the mandate of the team that went  on the  strength of its stake in the dpc  was to put across the idea that negotiation  was the requirement and not confrontation   echo in ls  the enron issue also echoed in the lok sabha today where the power minister   mr  suresh prabhu  said that scrapping of the agreement would cost the centre  rs  2  840 crores  whose liability in the project agreement was limited  the  centre  s liability in case of termination is one year  s electricity bill and  a termination fee of  300 million   blow to fis  the termination could prove to be a serious blow to the indian financial  institutions  fis  which  under the leadership of the idbi  were trying to  convince the other lenders of the project against the notice  the exposure of  indian fis in the project is understood to be not covered by any guarantee  either of the centre or the state   the times of india  friday  27 april 2001  enron ready to pull out  but lenders say wait  the dabhol power company board  which met on wednesday in london  authorised  the company management to issue a termination notice to the maharashtra state  electricity board  the company  however  may not pull out of the project yet   considering its lenders  who met on monday  opposed such a move and favoured  renegotiations  sources present during both the meetings said that though  foreign lenders supported enron on the termination issue  domestic financial  institutions  led by the industrial development bank of india  prevailed over  the deliberations to oppose any such drastic move  enron needs the lenders   consent to file a pre  termination notice for pulling out from the project   the decision to empower dpc chief wade cline to issue a termination notice  was taken with six votes in favour against a single idbi vote against such a  move   another significant development during the entire proceedings was that the  financial institutions made it clear that further funding of phase ii of the  project will depend on the government of india assuring payment mechanisms   institutions are yet to disburse about 30 per cent of the sanctioned package   which is crucial for completing the phase ii expansion project    the board  has given powers to wade cline to issue a pre  termination notice  but the  meeting quite unanimously felt the need of the hour is not to terminate the  project but to initiate serious re  negotiation proceedings    said mseb  chairman vinay bansal  who attended the board meeting    mseb presented their  views to the board members and it was understood by enron which also included  the rs 401 crore penalty issue which is heading for arbitration proceedings     we have also made it clear that the tariff structure of enron is quite high  and a downward revision of tariffs is unavoidable   bansal added     they cannot issue a termination notice without our consent since our  exposure in the project is quite large and the lenders should approve any  plans in that direction    said a top banker who was present during the  lenders  meet    there is a general consensus that the project must be  completed and the proposal to terminate the ppa should be kept in abeyance     he added  the global arrangers for the dpc include anz investment bank   credit suisse first boston  abn  amro  citibank and the state bank of india   where all these parties conducted separate meetings with the company  officials  however  some bankers said the company can file a termination  notice even if one lender with a minimum 5 per cent exposure on the project  favours such proceedings   meanwhile  in a clear reversal of roles  maharashtra chief minister vilasrao  deshmukh said that the state government was not keen on terminating the ppa     we will ask them to refrain from taking any such harsh steps since that  would be bad news for all of us  including dpc    deshmukh said  deshmukh was  echoing union power minister suresh prabhu  s sentiments  who said that the  government wanted an amicable settlement of the payment row  he  however   added that termination of the project would not hurt foreign investments  and  dismissed warnings by analysts that winding up the  2  9 billion project would  be a blow to india  s efforts to woo foreign investors   the dpc has already slapped one conciliation notice on the centre and three  arbitration notices on the state government over non  payment of dues  amounting to rs 213 crore and interest towards the bills due for december  2000 and january 2001  meanwhile  mseb officials said in mumbai that the  march bills amounting to rs 134 crore was paid on thursday as protest  payment  despite the dispute over the amount   when asked on the future course of action  bansal said it was up to the dpc   the hindu businessline  friday  april 27  2001  dpc board authorises md to issue ppa termination notice  the board of directors of dabhol power company  dpc  has authorised the  managing director  mr neil mcgregor  to issue the notice of intent to  terminate its power purchase agreement  ppa  with the maharashtra state  electricity board  mseb    at an appropriate time    the decision was taken  at a board meeting held in london yesterday    while mseb  which is an   interested party   was not allowed to vote  it made a presentation  clarifying its stand on the matter    a senior state government official  said   the resolution to authorise the management to issue the termination notice  was carried by six votes to one  idbi voted against the decision  the  official said  the serving of the preliminary termination notice will lead to  a six  month   suspension period    according to clause 17  8 of the  termination procedure  of the ppa    following the giving of a preliminary  termination notice  the parties shall consult for a period of six months  or  such longer period as they may agree  as to what step shall be taken with a  view to mitigating the consequences of the relevant event having regard to  all the circumstances       idbi and state bank of india  the principal indian lenders  had earlier  persuaded the overseas lenders to hold their consent to the termination  notice for some more time  at least one lender has to consent for the company  to serve termination notice  it is understood that overseas lenders are in  favour of termination of the project and are prepared to consent  however   domestic lenders are worried about the security of their advances if the ppa  is abandoned mid  way   according to institutional sources  indian lenders are trying to get all the  parties concerned to thrash out outstanding issues  the maharashtra and  central governments too are in favour of a conciliation  mr vilasrao  deshmukh  chief minister of maharashtra  yesterday went on record that the  state did not want the project terminated  mr yashwant sinha  union finance  minister  is also understood to be of the same opinion    the dpc will now  have to decide what is the  appropriate time  to serve the notice    the  official said  mseb pays rs 134 crore  meanwhile  mseb has paid dpc rs 134  crore towards its march 2001 bill  mseb officials confirmed that the bill was  paid  in protest   today morning    they  dpc  had billed us for an amount of  rs 146 crore  we do not agree with some of the items included    a senior  mseb official said   the pioneer  friday  april 27  2001  enron testing maharashtra  s nerves  t n raghunatha  dabhol power company  dpc  has begun to put fresh pressure on the maharashtra  state electricity board  mseb   the maharashtra state government and the  centre for an early resolution to the prolonged dispute between them  if the  dpc board of directors  decision to authorise its managing director to serve  a contract termination notice to the mseb is any indication   the dpc board  in its meeting in london on wednesday  empowered the company  management to sever its power supply agreement with mseb  a move that could  inflict a financial liability of rs 2  840 crore on the centre  the decision  to authorise the dpc management to issue a termination notice to mseb was  taken by a vote of six to one after the maharasthra government  representatives were prevented from voting on the ground of  interested  party    when contacted  the company  s mumbai  based spokesperson  mr jimmy mogal   declined to comment on the reports about the decision taken by the dpc board    we have nothing to say on the reports emanating from london  we will express  our views after a few days   he said  however  maharashtra chief minister  vilasrao deshmukh on thursday termed the dpc board  s decision as   unfortunate    we have already requested the company not to take any harsh  decision   mr deshmukh said in mumbai   official sources in the state energy ministry interpreted the dpc board  s  decision as a pressure tactic employed by the enron subsidiary to force the  mseb to clear the pending power bills without any further delay  through its  tough posture  the dpc wants to make its position stronger before it can  formally agree for re  negotiations with the mseb  the centre and the state  government for cutting the price of power supplied by it to the state  electricity board  the sources said that the dpc  s reported decision to  authorise its managing director to stop electricity supply to the mseb did  not mean that the enron subsidiary would actually go ahead with the scrapping  of the power contract with the mseb    if anything  the dpc  s reported decision is to mount additional pressure on  the mseb for clearance of pending power bills and put itself in a stronger  position in settling its dispute with the mseb  as part of its plan to arm  itself with powers to break a contract in case situation goes beyond its  control  the dpc had recently served a political force majeure to the mseb   the centre and the state government   the sources said  not surprisingly  the  dpc  s london decision comes on the heels of the maharashtra government  s  decision to set up a high  level committee  comprising representatives of the  mseb  the centre and the state government to re  negotiate with the enron  s  subsidiary company for reducing the cost of power supplied to the state  electricity board  meanwhile  amidst the threat of a possible termination  notice hanging on its head  the mseb on thursday made a  protest payment  of  the rs 134 crore disputed amount towards march bill of rs 146  64 crore to dpc   riday  april 27  the telegraph  friday  april 27  2001  enron signal to switch off dabhol power  enron today took the first decisive step out of the controversy  ridden dabhol  power company when it won an authorisation from the company   s board to stop  sale of power to maharashtra state electricity board  mseb    the meeting of the company  of which the houston  based energy giant holds 65  per cent and the mseb 15 per cent  was attended by state energy secretary v m  lal and mseb technical director p paunikar and it came days after its lenders  discussed payment problems and a possible termination  the centre   s liability   if enron decides to snap the agreement  will be a year   s power bill and a  termination fee of  300 million  however  the company will have to wait for  six months from the day it serves the notice before it pulls the plug  the  centre shrugged off the move  saying there would not be any adverse effect on  foreign investment in power if enron walks out    we do not see fdi inflows  into the power sector being hit   8 power minister suresh prabhu said  mseb  officials said the ball is now in the court of dpc  which said its corporate  policy did not allow it to comment on proceedings at board meetings  the  decision coincided with a rs 134  crore   protest payment   by the cash  strapped  power board as part of the march bill worth rs 146  64 crore   there was speculation that mseb coughed up the amount to cool frayed tempers  at enron   s hub in houston  and because it was rattled by the sudden turn of  events in the past few days during which the dispute had come to a head  mseb  officials brushed away the allusions  saying the cheque was ready on  wednesday but could not be handed over to dpc because of the state  wide  bandh    we have a disputed payment of rs 12  64 crore  which will be taken up  at the dispute  resolution forum   8 a board official said  last week  dpc told  the state government and mseb it would no longer accept protest payments in a  move to fortify its legal position   mseb officials say bechtel and general electric  the other partners who hold  around 20 per cent in dpc  are willing to go along with enron corp in  terminating the deal but financial institutions such as idbi are not game  because it puts their loans at risk  investments made by indian institutions  are not covered under the centre   s and state   s counter  guarantees  unlike  those made by international lenders  maharashtra chief minister vilasrao  deshmukh called enron   s decision unfortunate    we had told state government  officials attending the enron board meeting to stop the company from winding  up its operations in the state as it will harm both parties   8  the statesman  friday  april 27  2001  enron threatens to pull out  the enron crisis deepened with the board of directors of the dabhol power  company deciding to authorise the managing director  mr k wade cline  to  serve a notice of termination on the contract for the first phase of the  2  9  billion power project  the decision  which could lead to the cessation of  dabhol   s power supply to the state  was taken at the meeting held yesterday  in london according to reports quoting the chairman of the maharashtra state  electricity board  mr vinay bansal   while dpc officials refuse to comment on anything  it is learnt that mseb was  itself prepared to serve a legal notice of termination just two days before  the meeting  mseb was said to have been dissuaded by the nationalist congress  party president  mr sharad pawar  and union power minister mr suresh prabhu   who had talks in new delhi with the maharashtra chief minister  mr vilasrao  deshmukh  and an mseb delegation last monday   the state government has been served two arbitration notices while the centre  is ready to go for conciliation with the dpc for failing to honour its  counter  guarantee  further  the dpc has already slapped a notice of political  force majeure which protects itself against undeserved claims in the event of  exigencies that force it to take an extreme step  the union power minister  mr  suresh prabhu  contended in delhi that since dpc contributed only 0  7 per  cent of the total energy output of the country  its termination would not  have such a phenomenal impact on the power situation   however  if terminations proceedings go through  enron corp  a 65 per cent  share  holder in the dabhol power company  would stand to net a hefty amount  in damages  the union power secretary has been quoted as saying that  termination of the dpc would cost the centre rs 1  800 crore  which is the  total of one years   electricity bill and a termination fee of  300 million   according to an energy analyst  mr pradyumna kaul  the total liability would  not cross rs 350 crore  however mr prabhu said in the lok sabha today that  the that scrapping of the agreement would cost the centre rs 2  840 crore  it  is learnt that on 20 april  mr deshmukh had given the go  ahead to the mseb to  prepare a legal notice to be issued to enron during the meeting of the dpc   s  board of directors on wednesday  at the meeting  the energy minister   padamsinh patil  energy secretary  mr vinay mohan lal and mseb chairman mr  vinay bansal  were also present  the notice was prepared over the past weekend  and taken by the delegation when they called on mr prabhu on 24 april   however  the politicians convinced them that enron would not get tough  given  its huge stake in the project  and that such a notice would not be necessary   the meeting thus ended with the decision to renegotiate the power tariff   with enron   s consent   among those present at the london meeting were mr lal  mr bansal and mseb  technical director  mr p paunikar  in their capacity as directors  however   they abstained from voting since they were deemed an interested party  the  only vote to go against the decision was that of the idbi which is also  represented on the board  it is learnt  the chief minister  mr vilasrao  deshmukh  said the state was not in favour of terminating the project  this  could mean that the latest manoeuvre to arm  twist the indian authorities  could achieve its immediate target of getting the arrears accumulated over  the past three months cleared  the mseb owes enron rs 146  64 crore for march  2001 and rs 229 crore for december 2000 and january 2001  the centre today put  up a brave face on enron   s decision saying there would not be any adverse  effect on foreign investment in power sector in the country  pti reported  from new delhi     there will be no adverse impact as a result of any action by any domestic or  foreign company  as far as we are concerned there will be no adverse impact  on fdi in power sector   8 power minister suresh prabhu told reporters when  asked about dpc   s decision to authorise management to issue a termination  notice to mseb  emphasising that there would be no fallout of such decision   prabhu said after the meeting of the cabinet committee on economic affairs    we are expecting cooperation from many scandinavian countries as well as  european nations in the power sector    in fact not only the power minister but  also the prime minister of norway was here to inaugurate a seminar on power  and he promised lot of cooperation in the sector   8  mid day   dpc may not wind up   maharashtra chief secretary v ranganathan has said that though neil mcgregor   managing director of the dabhol power corporation  dpc   has been given  complete powers with regard to dpc  s operations in the state  including the  authority to wind up operations  it does not necessarily mean that mcgregor  will issue such a termination notice  mcgregor was given the powers at a  meeting of the dpc board in london on wednesday  ranganathan said that state  officials  including maharashtra state electricity board  mseb  chairman  vinay bansal and power secretary v m lal  have reported back to him about the  meeting in london   with regard to the state  s failure to pay enron  ranganathan said   bills  are prepared as per the power purchase agreement  ppa  and dpc owes some  money to us  our people informed enron officials about this   in fact  there  was no reason to give powers to the md to slap a termination notice   in the  london meeting  mseb and industrial development bank of india  idbi   representatives insisted that the dpc must pay rs 411 crore since it could  not supply power whenever needed   chief minister vilasrao deshmukh has already termed as unfortunate the  decision of the board of the enron  promoted dpc to give mcgregor powers to  wind up operations  deshmukh added   we have already requested enron not to  take any harsh decision   deshmukh had earlier said   we have directed state  government officials attending the dpc board meeting to desist the energy  company from winding up operations in the state  as it would be harmful to  both of us    enron officials are keeping mum on the issue  mcgregor said   i am not going  to give any comment    mid day  april 27  2001  enron offers  no comment  on renegotiation  h s rao  a crucial meeting of the board of directors of the dabhol power company   dpc   promoted by the us energy major enron  was held here yesterday  apparently to discuss fate of its  900  million power project in maharashtra   but there was no official word on the indian and state governments  decision  to renegotiate the contract   an enron spokesman declined to divulge what transpired at the meeting  saying  the issues discussed at the meeting were  confidential    we have not  received any direct communication  unless we get it and evaluate the details   we have no comments to make   the spokesman said when asked about the  proposed decision on re  negotiation of the project in which the maharashtra  state electricity board  mseb  has 15 per cent stake   asked whether the board had taken a decision on empowering dpc managing  director neil mcgregor to wind up its operations in india  the spokesman said  he had nothing to say on them  enron has reportedly authorised mcgregor to  look at various options including selling the company  s stake in dpc   maharashtra chief minister vilasrao deshmukh said in mumbai that the state  government would pay up the undisputed dues to the company  he said the  maharashtra government  is not in favour of terminating the 2184  mw project   but wanted an amicable solution to the imbroglio    mid day  friday  april 27  2001   committee to renegotiate enron deal  a committee to renegotiate the power purchase agreement with the dabhol power  company will be appointed by this evening  chief minister vilasrao deshmukh  said today  addressing media persons after his meeting with the noted social  reformer anna hazare at his official residence varsha  deshmukh said the  committee would be formed by this evening or by tomorrow  at the most  he  termed as unfortunate the enron board decision empowering dpc chief neil  mcgregor to serve a preliminary termination notice on the maharashtra state  electricity board and said the state was willing to negotiate the issue with  power company    renegotiations will be held as per the suggestions made by the godbole  committee and the center will also depute its representative on the  renegotiating committee  we don  t want to take any hasty decision   deshmukh  saidhe pointed that the only bone of contention with the dpc had been its  expensive tariff and hoped that the issue would be resolved amicably  when  pointed that the enron board had taken a decision to serve the notice despite  state  9 s willingness to appoint a renegotiating committee  chief minister  said it was unfortunate   earlier  in his meeting with hazare  deshmukh promised to make necessary  amendments to the right to information law recently passed by the state so  that the information was easily accessed by the common people  he also gave a  patient hearing to hazare on his complaints of corruption in various state  departments and promised action against guilty after a thorough inquiry  within three months   afternoon  april 27  2001   enron  s on    state govt  to renegotiate dabhol power project  by hubert vaz  the us power giant  enron power corporation  s willingness to wrap up the  dabhol power project and leave the shores may not actually materialise   though the dabhol power company chief  mr  wade cline  has been authorised to  do so  since the lenders for the project would have a decisive say in the  matter   disclosing this  chief minister vilasrao deshmukh confirmed this morning that  the state government would churn out a compromise formula by which the power  project at dabhol could be continued  and at the same time enron did not feel  slighted   enron has not yet conveyed to us about this decision  we are  waiting for their letter   he said  when asked what sort of compromise the  state government plans to forge  mr  deshmukh said   let our officers come  back  after that we will decide a future course of action  but we are  definitely going in for renegotiation of the project  it is very difficult to  predict the outcome of enron  s decision but as of now the project is still  on   when asked whether the project could be moved to another state  if wound  up from maharashtra  mr  deshmukh said  that was not possible as per the  terms of the agreement between the us company and the state government   however  it was difficult for the project to move out of the state itself  he  indicated  he also confirmed that both parties would face considerable losses  if the project was terminated   the board of directors of the dabhol power company  which met in london on  wednesday  decided to put an end to all controversies surrounding the project  once and for all by empowering the dpc chief to terminate the project  if he  deemed it fit  however  this decision  as of now  does not necessarily  indicate the death knell for the project  the enron project  which had been  riddled with controversies right from its inception  had been a pretext for  the political parties in the state to drag each other on the mat from time to  time  the previous sena  bjp government  which had been out to terminate the  project  however  chose to continue with it following renegotiations with  enron  s top visiting officials like ms  rebecca mark  and  the democratic  front government inherited the controversial project when the governments  changed hands a year and a half ago   meanwhile  state energy minister dr  padamsinh patil  when contacted at the  osmanabad circuit house  said the state government and the central government  have decided to appoint a joint committee to renegotiate the project with  enron   it is not easy for them to walk out of the project just like that   they will have to go in for litigation and this would prove costly for both  sides   he said  in case the project is terminated  the government can still  manage the power needs of the state  though it would be a bit tough job  he  added ,0

called    the biggest financial bubble in history   what makes this real estate market so  risky is that the crazy speculation in housing has spread around the world   people continue to buy houses simply because  prices are rising   without any  regard to fundamentals  this is similar to what happened with the stock market  during the 1990  s  when investors bought shares of profitless companies just  because everyone else was doing the same  in fact  many of thepeople who  have gotten or are getting into real estate are the ones that got killed by the  stock market during the 2000 crash  consequently  these will probably be the  same people that get burned when the global housing bubble bursts  prices in  australia and britain are already sliding  america  s housing market may

 non  firm power curve building  hi vince   amitava and i have received a request to build a non  firm power curve for  each region from david hoog  s double trigger folks  the objective  as they  explain it  is to allow the desk to buy non  firm from the market  buy david  s  outage product  and sell firm to the market  accountants would like a curve  to mark the non  firm position   my initial thought is that the desk should provide this non  firm curve  but  it seems that this market is very illiquid and they are reluctant so they  have put the ball in david hoog  s court to build the curve if david wants to  sell his product internally to the desk   assuming we build the curve  the next issue is how to define  non  firm    the only way i can think of is to tie the non  firmness to a specific  generation unit or group of units  this will allow the purchase of david  s  outage product to cover the non  firmness risk  tying the definition of  non  firmness to a whole region seems implausible    what does it mean to  give a marketer the option to not deliver power if there is any problem  anywhere in the region  consequently  the non  firm curve takes on a  unit  level interpretation  and not a region  level interpretation   consequently  i do not see how we can talk about the  non  firm curve for the  region   we will need to build a non  firm curve for each generation unit or  group of units   maybe i could get your thoughts later today   thanks   vasant,0

 pricing credit on thousands of names  all   our challenge for the next few months is to build an automated system to  provide differential pricing on thousands of credits  5  000 by year  end    most of these credits will be illiquid in terms of market price information   making the challenge harder  and the end result more important in terms of  competitive pricing advantage  what we need is an overall strategy for how we  plan to achieve this from the quantitative perspective   currently we have several models for credit pricing either in use or under  development   fmc model  default probability approach   using bloomberg  s fair market  par  yield  curves  probabilities are generated from the risky  libor  then  default  bankruptcy swap prices computed using expectation methodology   fmc model  credit spread approach   using the fmcs  then directly taking the  libor credit spread at each tenor  adjusting for basis and compounding  differences   bond model  fmc approach   taking the fmcs as benchmark curves  the model  regresses the input bonds  specific to a name  on the two best fitting  benchmarks  the result is a zero yield curve with the same shape as the fmcs   but with the level tweaked for the specific issuer  prices are then generated  using both spread and probability approaches  under testing   bond model  spline approach   taking only the bonds specific to an issuer   the model fits an exponential cubic spline to the zero  coupon price curve   then builds a zero yield curve from this  under testing   market prices  for certain liquid names  or sectors  ratings  cds market  prices are used  then recovery and event discount used to get bankruptcy swap  prices   kmv  using expected default frequencies  edfs  from the kmv model and  database  we will build a model to price default swaps  making appropriate  risk adjustments  kmv is being installed now  so model will be worked on next   each of these models returns a price  credit default and bankruptcy   and the  accuracy of the price depends on many factors  liquidity and regulatory  differences between bond and cds markets  recovery assumptions  risk premia   capital charges  etc  the aim will be to accurately price as many liquid  names as possible  based upon these models  then use these prices  alongside  other financial information  as the backbone to a full automated pricing  system   our inputs to the proposed pricing system for a specific name are model and  market prices for all issuers  alongside name  specific  soft  data from  credit reports and financial statements  if the credit is liquid enough  a  price will be generated from their own information only  otherwise  the  credit will be mapped onto a subset of liquid credits  with financial  information and historical price movements providing the mapping and weights   the model price will then be periodically adjusted to align itself with  market  or trader  prices  and this adjustment will feed back into the  weighting and mapping composition  in loose terms  we could think of the  system price for an illiquid credit as being a weighted average of liquid  market prices  bonds  equities  default swaps   where the weightings are  calibrated using credit analysis  financial ratios  etc   the key steps to implementing such a system will be   establishing what exactly we want to  predict   is it a price  a rating  a  probability  or a score  we will need a clean market history to calibrate to   which we only really have for ratings  we will then need to develop a mapping  from rating  score to price   getting and cleaning the historical financial and credit data required to  calibrate the model   building the mechanics of the model  ie  the calibration methodology  neural  nets  fuzzy logic seem the obvious candidates  but which exact methods and  software packages to use   determining an automated methodology for mapping names with limited  information into the model   getting the  true  market price  in order to feed back an error  at present  such a price exists for very few credits   allocating resources to the development  mckinsey claimed such a system would  take 6  10 man  months to develop   further ideas or comments are requested  as we need to develop our strategy  asap  the model description above is fairly vague  as we don  t yet have the  knowledge needed to fill in the specific details  further help will be  especially required on this if we are to continue to move at  internet speed    regards  ben,0

 presentation  integrating market risk and credit risk  all   i will be giving a 40 min presentation on the above topic at the eprm energy  2000 conference in april  the bulletpoints are   balancing market risk and credit risk to achieve a reliable estimation of  total risk  incorporating market risk into a credit risk model  calculating probability of default using credit risk and market risk  refining business practice to reflect credit risk and market risk evaluations  my proposed approach is to quickly step through the practical process of  modelling credit risk  resulting in measures for expected loss and  credit  var  then show how default probs can be calculated using bond and  equity data  finally i  ll describe how credit risk can be mitigated using  credit derivatives  plugging enroncredit  com of course   any other ideas for broad topics and  or specific points to mention will be  appreciated  the presentation has to be submitted next week   many thanks   ben,0

 re  steve leppard  dale   my recommendation is to make steve the head of the research unit in london   we were talking originally about september but i think we should accelerate  this process   of course  anjam will be very unhappy about it  but we cannot manage around  him  any longer   i think that the promotion should be combined with a salary increase   i would like to offer him a significant increase that  goes with expanded responsibilities and much higher visibility   a salary increase will also bring him closer to the market   we see the market for technical people going through the roof in  practically every location  where we operate   a contract is not a good solution in my view  it creates a sense of false  security for  both an employee and the company   i shall send a message to john sherriff with my recommendation  i shall cc  you   i would appreciate if you could bring it up with john as well   vince  dale surbey  07  11  2000 10  23 am  to  vince j kaminski  hou  ect  ect  cc   subject  steve leppard  hi vince   hr is working on a mid  year salary review for london people that have a  noticeable gap between their compensation at enron and what we would have to  pay in the market for a replacement  they highlighted steve as someone with  a potential gap  particularly in light of what we  re seeing in our quant  recruiting effort for credit trading and research   i  d like your opinion on the best way to make sure we keep steve happy and  keep him at enron  there are several things i see we can do   1  give him a mid  year pay increase to move him closer to market  i  m not  sure this is the best way to go  especially if we only offer him a token  salary increase   2  offer him more responsibility  what are your thoughts on timing for  making steve the official head of the london research team  with my move to  ebs  should we accelerate this  i think this is good way to keep him happy  and motivated  and then follow up with a more meaningful salary review at  year  end  as part of the regular process  that takes into account his greater  responsibility   3  we have some people that we  re trying to get under long  term  3  yr   contract with a 12  month notice clause  obviously anyone signing one of  these will want significant up  front compensation for being handcuffed   we  ve not had a lot of success with these here in london  and i would prefer  to keep steve happy so he wants to stay with enron rather than contractually  binding him to the job   i  d value your thoughts on this   thanks   dale,0

org  cc   bcc  ravi thuraisingham  enron communications   subject  material for thu 2 mar wg meeting  hello all   appended below you  ll find a summary of ideas that people have contributed  since we at caida began to get the metrics wg started  some of this  material has already appeared on the metrics mailing list  the older  material comes from personal emails  i  m posting it again to give us all  some more ideas to think about   for those who are able to attend the wg meeting in san jose this thursday   2 mar   i  d like to spend time in the morning getting to know about  attendees interests and experience in making internet measurements   i suggest that a good way to do this would be to have each group give a  short  10 minutes  response times  and this gets even more interesting    you only need   to be able to see traffic in one direction  from client to server  to   get a fairly accurate round  trip time from the client to the server    irrespective of how far away the client is from your measurement   host   because of tcps three  way handshake for connection   establishment  when you see the opening syn  you wait for the client   to ack the server  s syn ack and you have the client   server round  trip   time  i think you  ve actually already done some of this  we could   also potentially try to correlate dns queries and tcp connections    perhaps determining some probabilities in a given environment of a   host initiating a tcp connection to a host for which it just received   an a record  and track various application  level response times  i  d   personally love to have a lot of data on the ratio of dns response   time to tcp transfer time for http connections   even if the   measurement makes no attempt to discern what constitutes a web   transaction to the user  a full page  usually many tcp connections       anyway  i think there are some fairly interesting things we can   measure with simple techniques  these are just some simple ones    there may be some interesting things we could do by digging into   payloads of a few of the other highly  utilized applications  but doing   it for tcp is a nightmare perfomance  wise  but we now have the basic   infrastructure to do things with dns over udp  we can probably cover   any open udp protocol without incurring performance penalties that   would make it completely unusable  snmp  for example    while its   application is limited  network service providers would find   round  trip time information for snmp packets from their network   management stations to agents very useful  i think there are some   rudimentary things we can do with tcp as well  and i also think some   sites would be interested in having some rudimentary information  for   example  a weighted  by traffic  round  trip time distribution for tcp   traffic to  from all networks with which you communicated  say at  24   granularity   this gives sites a notion of how close they are to   those they talk to most frequently  with a little more work  we could   probably make reasonable bandwidth estimates for every end network for   which we see tcp data  we could certainly get a reasonable number for   the maximum observed bandwidth       these methods also decouple the measurement from the traffic  while we   all know the value of that  i think it  s significant in that active   probers can be run on the same host  decoupled from the actual   measurement  and with timestamps coming from kernel space  bpf   i  ve   been thinking about this for a long time  because eventually i  d like   skitter  and other tools  to be able to do use tcp packets for probing    with no need for things like ip firewall code  if i can just properly   time non  blocking connects  and count on the passive tool to see the syn   and syn ack  i can use any tcp port for round  trip time measurements and   not trick my kernel by sending tcp packets on a raw socket  i need   feedback from the passive tool for tracing like skitter  it needs to   know when a reply has been seen from a hop and when the destination has   been reached   but it  s not difficult  simple bytestream  oriented ipc is   sufficient       going further  i like the idea proposed by some others  maybe funded at   this point  i  m not tracking it  of instrumenting the freenix tcp  ip   stacks  a lot of useful information could be pulled from the stack    but eventually someone  s going to have to come up with what pieces of   information are desirable enough for someone to want their stack   instrumented  and it  ll have to be somewhere between what  s currently     implemented and a full  blown metering system like rtfm   and i think in   the interim  there are a lot of things we could do using libpcap on our   local machines  non  promiscuous and in user space  safe  easy to   implement and test   to me the benefits here are       a user is likely to have a tangible  well  understood relationship   with their workstation  understood by them   this is particularly   true for those of us with network expertise  so it  s at least   plausible that we can find correlations of measurements with   user experience in a fairly short period of time  helping us hone in   on what  s useful  even if we only find weak correlations  for   whatever reason   once a correlation exists  more people will be   interested in helping with development because it  ll be something   they  ll use personally     we  re essentially guaranteed to see traffic in both directions      i  d personally be interested in trying to find some small sets of   information that correlate to user experiences  so that it doesn  t   take a terabyte of disk and 64 processors to deal with data from say   10  000 desktops         anyway  just some random thoughts  the hard part for me at the moment   is thinking about useful generalizations and infrastructure to support   them     cindy bickerstaff responded     we  re just starting to capture the mss and window size negotiations between   timeit and servers to get an idea of what is typical or usual  wonder if   daniel  s code could do that too from the various traffic monitoring points   caida has out there  the data could be used to fill in some parameters for   trying to model some of the passive data collected  since a typical web page   has many elements between a single client and server the first or base page   gives you a starting idea of what to expect and the subsequent elements are   like repeat measurements of the same path over a very short time interval    since there is a strong time of day  week effect  volumes and perf   the   short duration of the data collection from a single web page  incl    elements  might give some options for modeling  and maybe getting a better   estimate of packet loss   i  ve really enjoyed joining the e 2 e  interest group   for the ideas on factors and the references to past modeling attempts  e  g    mathis  et  al  paper    ack its bulk transfer focus    paul krumviede highlighted the difficulty of agreeing on details  of how to measure common metrics like availability  reliability   throughput and latency    an example was throughput  since it was proposed   that this be measured using a tcp file transfer of   random data  one concern was what does this do   to latency  and where does this get measured  as   many customers of this service would not be large   businesses  measuring this from the customer end   of a 56  or 64  kbps circuit was almost certain to   drive end  to  end latency measurements beyond   defined bounds  measuring it from within points in   the provider  s network  s  might show figures that the   customers could never see themselves      the compromise was to define the throughput metric   as ocurring at access link loads of no more than 50    of the bit rate  but how does one measure that  and   so on        given that this discussion was recognized as being the   prelude to the imposition of minimal slas  as part of the    certification  process for service providers  this may be   an illustration of the perils of discussing slas and metrics   in some interchangable form  but they may not be easy   to separate in the minds of some   carter bullard said   i  m specifically interested in bridging   rtfm and ippm work  particularly to describe how an   rtfm can be a generic connectivity monitor  ippm   describes type  p  unidirection and bidirectional   connectivity  and a single point rtfm can detect   these conditions  but standard descriptions for how   this can be done would be very useful      personally  one of the things that i  m interested   in is tcp based streaming services performance  such   as that seen in internet radio distribution  and of   course ip telephony wireline performance metrics would   be very good to describe   nevil brownlee comments that he  s also very interested in  developing the rtfm meter as a platform for more general measurements   two areas seem interesting  apart from getting more information  from tcp streams      qos  difserv performance   what metrics do we need to characterise this     ipsec  what metrics will still be useful when we can  t  look at port numbers  what kinds of traffic can still be  identified    curtis villamizar said   i  m particularly interested in the work on dos at   http    www  cs  washington  edu  homes  savage  traceback  html and would   like to see that on the agenda   this would provide a general way of determining where packets came from   not just a tool for tracing dos attacks  ,0

 el paso statement on california situation  in case you haven  t already seen this   el paso addresses the california energy situation  february 26  2001   houston  feb  26  prnewswire    el paso corporation  nyse  epg   reaffirmed today its continuing commitment to work with all parties  involved to help improve california  s energy situation   we are surprised  to see continuing misinformation in the media concerning el paso  s  involvement in california   said norma dunn  senior vice president of  corporate communications and external affairs at el paso corporation   we  would like to take this opportunity to clarify the record   the  significant increase in electricity demand at a time when available power  supplies are short has caused a sharp climb in the price of power  which  has in turn increased the price of natural gas used to generate  electricity  high natural gas prices are  therefore  an effect rather than  a cause of the power shortage  allegations that natural gas prices were  deliberately manipulated by withholding capacity on the el paso natural gas  pipeline overlook critical facts and are demonstrably untrue  it is not  possible for any holder of capacity on the el paso natural gas pipeline to  cause a significant increase in california gas prices by refusing to use  that capacity  the el paso natural gas pipeline is required by law to post  the availability of any unused capacity on its public bulletin board and is  obligated to sell that capacity for no more than the published tariff rate  found to be just and reasonable by the federal energy regulatory  commission  all capacity held by el paso merchant energy on the el paso  natural gas pipeline has been used or made available for use by others to  serve california and other western markets  allegations that there was a   conspiracy  in 1996 to limit new interstate pipeline capacity into  california are absolutely refuted by facts that no one can challenge  the  facts show that all new pipelines considered during the 1990 s were either  built or were not viable projects because they lacked sufficient customer  support to justify their construction  for example  despite years of  marketing efforts by tenneco  not a single potential customer could be  induced to make the sort of binding commitment required for the proposed  altamont project to proceed  for that reason alone  it was ultimately  dropped  in 1996  according to estimates  there were between one and two  billion cubic feet per day  bcf  d  of excess natural gas transportation  capacity on existing interstate pipelines serving california  indeed  it  was misplaced reliance on the continuing availability of such excess  capacity that prompted the california public utilities commission to  encourage pg  e  socal edison  and socal gas  beginning in 1996 and  continuing into 1998  to relinquish over 1  5 bcf  d of firm transportation  capacity on the el paso natural gas pipeline  processes are now under way  to assess present demand and support for new interstate pipeline capacity  into california  and el paso intends to do its part to help satisfy  whatever needs may be established today  as recently as last year  there  were periods when significant quantities of unused capacity were available  on the el paso natural gas pipeline that were not necessary to meet demands  at that time  notwithstanding its availability  this capacity was not used  by shippers to california to fill in  state natural gas storage facilities  for future use  if california had taken advantage of the opportunity in  2000 to store the same volumes of natural gas that had been stored in 1999   reliance on the spot market would have been reduced and the steep rise in  prices at the california border could have been substantially mitigated or  avoided  it is now widely recognized that the california  energy crisis   was caused by the inability of the supply of power available in california  to keep pace with the state  s economy and increased demand  a combination  of factors caused a sharp increase in power prices  first  the construction  of new power plants in california is a slow  difficult  and heavily  regulated process  as a result  the growing demand has far outstripped  in  state generating capabilities  second  unfavorable precipitation and  increased out  of  state demand caused some of the hydroelectric power  normally relied on by california to become unavailable  third  increased  demand for power in the western united states drove up prices that  california had to pay to out  of  state generators  fourth  state policies  deregulated wholesale power prices but capped the rates paid by consumers   leaving demand unrestrained and preventing utilities from recovering their  costs  fifth  because rate caps prevented utilities from passing increased  costs to consumers  the utilities  creditworthiness was impaired  causing  supplemental power needed during peak periods to become more difficult and  expensive to purchase  sixth  the early and greater  than  normal use of  peaking units  plants that are designed to only operate under peak demand  conditions  necessitated unscheduled maintenance  rendering them unavailable  at critical times  seventh  during the final months of 2000  some power  plants were forced to shut down because increased usage exhausted their air  emissions credits  eighth  a warm summer followed by an early onset of cold  weather further drove up demand for power  finally  the increased power  costs in california could have been substantially mitigated through  long  term power contracts and less reliance on the volatile short  term  power market   california is currently in a difficult position  but now  has the opportunity to refine its regulatory model and craft a long  term  energy policy   said dunn   el paso has been one of the largest suppliers  of energy to california for more than 50 years  and we are actively  participating with all parties in california to be a part of a long  term   stable solution to california  s energy needs   el paso corporation  the  largest and most broadly based natural gas company in the world  spans the  energy value chain from wellhead to electron  with an enterprise value in  excess of  50 billion  el paso is a leader in every phase of the natural  gas industry  the company owns and operates a significant portion of the  north american natural gas delivery grid  operates the fastest growing   most sophisticated energy merchant group
